  But if a player wants to give someone advice what to do at night based on info that was known the previous day that is fine,
  or as a Minion lean over to their Demon and tell them who they should kill.

          <p>Mechanically, nothing.
  Their vote is still counted, otherwise the total will be less than it should be, automatically hard confirming the <span class="Outsider">Butler</span>, which is unfair for the evil team.
  Also, mistakes happen, just play on for now.
        </p>
          <p>
  Later, the ST should speak with them privately and remind them of the constraints of their ability,
  and let them know that it is considered cheating to purposefully vote without their master.
  Generally this is enough to keep a player paying more attention,
  because most people are not playing this game in bad faith nor looking to cheat.
        </p>
          <p>
  It is also irrelevant if they knew, suspected or were totally unaware that they were drunk or poisoned when they voted.
  They should not attempt to vote without their master to test for drunkenness or poisoning,
  as their ability is a social contract that they must always abide by as they have no way of knowing if their ability is functioning or not.
        </p>
          <p>
  If they keep doing it though, then it should be dealt with however the group deals with cheating:
  ending the game early, letting it finish but talking about it after, not inviting that person back, etc.
  There is no prescriptive option for what to do with someone who is cheating, as that is a social issue for the group to handle.

  The <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> is able to register as different things to different characters independently.

        <h4 class="question">If only the Demon and the Twins are alive, can good still win?

        <div class="answer">
          <p>No.
        </p>
          <p>
  Although no win conditions have been met,
  the ST would usually end the game if only the Demon and the Twins are left alive,
  as it is impossible for good to win at this point.
        </p>
          <p>
  Should town elect to execute:
<ol><li>
   the Good Twin - the evil team wins via the <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span>'s win condition;
</li><li>
   the <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span> - the evil team wins because of only two living players left alive including the Demon;
</li><li>
   the Demon - the evil team wins because of only two living players left alive.
</li></ol></p>
          <p>
  Evil does not explicitly require the Demon to survive to final two to win.
  They just usually do, since good wins if there are no alive Demons.
  But the <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span> specifically prevents good from winning so long as both the Twins are alive.
  So even if the Demon is executed in final three then, despite the Demon being dead, as only two players left alive is evil's win condition, evil wins.
        </p>
          <p>
  This is why it is important for the town to resolve the Twin issue before final three.

          <p>Evil wins.
        </p>
          <p>
  Although the good team's win condition of no living Demons has been fulfilled,
  the <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span>'s ability means that good cannot win while both of the Twins are alive.
        </p>
          <p>
  Meanwhile the evil team has also met their win condition which is only two players left alive.
  Normally the final two would have to include the Demon for an evil win,
  but the Twins is an example of when this does not have to be the case.
  With nothing blocking the evil team's win, evil has won.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>No, the Good Twin was executed while the ET ability was malfunctioning and it does not trigger retroactively.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The ET is deceived as to their ability working, so they can be told an arbitrary player and a character.
  The actual Good Twin learns nothing, since their being informed is part of the ET's ability.
  When the ET is sober and healthy, if they learned incorrect info then they will learn the real info, and the Good Twin will learn the ET.
  While the ET is droisoned, executing the Good Twin does nothing.
        </p>
          <p>
  In SnV where the droisoned ET is rare, and impossible N1, STs will often wake the Twins together, and have them make eye contact.
  But on custom scripts where there is a chance of a droisoned ET it is best practice to wake the Twins separately,
  else the ET could be tipped off.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>The <span class="Townsfolk">Gossip</span> is a backwards-checking ability.
  During the previous day, even if they were drunk or poisoned, if the <span class="Townsfolk">Gossip</span> made a correct statement, the ST would have placed the <span class="Townsfolk">Gossip</span>'s dead reminder in the Grimoire.
  Then that night, as long as they are sober, healthy and alive at their turn in the night order, the <span class="Townsfolk">Gossip</span> kill goes through.
  If however they are drunk or poisoned tonight then there is no kill.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>No, it is not a continous check.
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> is a 'you start knowing' character, not a 'you know' character,
  so if their grandchild subsequently turns evil, she does not get a new grandchild and still dies if they die to the Demon.

          <p>Yes.
        </p>
          <p>
  The only restriction on the grandchild is that they are a good player.

          <p>The ST still marks a player as the grandchild, who can be evil,

  If the marked grandchild dies to the Demon

  When an ability does not specify that it must be another player then a character's ability can be applied to themself.

          <p>Yes, as long as they are unprotected, since their ability is active as soon as the game starts, and "at any time" means just that.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The UT must see the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span>.
  The UT evaluates the character not at the time that they wake but when the character died.

          <p>No.
        </p>
          <p>
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Undertaker</span>'s ability reads "you learn which character died by execution today" so the execution must cause the player to die.
  So executing dead players or protected players means the <span class="Townsfolk">Undertaker</span> receives no info.

          <p>The UT's sobriety and health matters only at their turn in the night order.
        </p>
          <p>
  The UT is a backward looking ability and sees the character of the most recently executed player at the time of their execution.
  If they were poisoned or drunk at the time of the execution but sober and healthy when they wake, then they will receive true info.
  In contrast, if they are drunk or poisoned when they wake at night then their info is arbirtary.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The poisoning:
<ul><li>
   targets a player sat in either direction of the Minion;
</li><li>
   must target a Townsfolk player, skipping over non-Townsfolk players, until a Townsfolk is encountered;
</li><li>
   does not skip dead Townsfolk;
</li><li>
   does not skip evil Townsfolk;
</li><li>
   does not need to target the <em>closest</em> Townsfolk neighbour - it is okay to target the Townsfolk sat further away in the other direction.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  Additionally, the poisoning is constantly checked so if the target becomes invalid, either by ceasing to be a Townsfolk or by an inbetween player becoming a Townsfolk,
  then the poisoning must be moved to a valid target, following the previous constraints.
        </p>
          <p>
  When sat between two Vigor-killed Minions it is valid, although probably not helpful, for the same Townsfolk player to be poisoned twice.

  The only time the poison can change target is if the poisoned player stops being a Townsfolk, or an intermediate player becomes a Townsfolk.

          <p>Most can with some exceptions.

          <p>
  Where any ability text says "choose a player" a dead player is still a player,

  When an ability can only target the living it will explicitly specify this, such as the <span class="Townsfolk">Chambermaid</span>'s.
        </p>
          <p>
  It is allowed corpses to be attacked with killing abilities,
  which is something the Demon might choose to do to mislead the good team about which characters are in play.
  But if a player went into the night phase already dead and are attacked they are not announced as having died in the morning,

  If there is an ability game end condition and a regular game end condition, the ability wins out,

  In general, there can only be a maximum of the number of Outsiders that are on the script, because players cannot have duplicate tokens.

  The sequence of events:
<ol><li>
   The <span class="Minion">Assassin</span> chooses the <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span>;
</li><li>
   The first part of the <span class="Minion">Assassin</span>'s ability triggers: "Once per game, at night*, choose a player: they die";
</li><li>
   The <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span>'s ability notes that the <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span> is about to die, so bounces the kill to another player who dies instead;
</li><li>
   As the <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span> is still alive the second part of the <span class="Minion">Assassin</span>'s ability, "even if for some reason they could not", triggers to kill the <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span>.

          <p>
  Since the result is a double kill it should probably be used sparingly.

  It is inherently impossible for a player to be successfully mad about being two different characters at the same time,

        <div class="answer">
          <p>In the case of the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> <span class="Townsfolk">Juggler</span>, there would have to be no new deaths by execution the day they juggled,

  For sure the <span class="Outsider">Mutant</span> is an unusual case as the acutal <span class="Outsider">Mutant</span> usually does not admit to being what they are,

          <p>Yes, unless the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> is drunk due to the <span class="Outsider">Puzzlemaster</span>'s setup ability.
        </p>
          <p><span class="Outsider">Puzzlemaster</span> drunkenness would prevent the Minions learning the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span>, as the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> is drunk during N1 setup.

  With that understood, using the <span class="Outsider">Puzzlemaster</span> to make the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> drunk is not recommended,

          <p>
  A fake exorcism means that the Demon does not learn of the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s choice(s), because the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> did not make any. 
  The Demon would not know why this is, as it is indistinguishable from the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> just being drunk or poisoned that night.

  The ST can show any player as the <span class="Townsfolk">Exorcist</span>, true or not, to the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>,

  but if the nominator was the <span class="Minion">Witch</span> cursed player then they are instantly announced as having died,
  before the <span class="Traveller">Gnome</span> can react.
  This makes it obvious to all that it was not the <span class="Traveller">Gnome</span> that caused the death.

  The Philo's once per game ability is used and they have failed to gain the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>'s ability.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>No, because the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> was out of play at the time of the pick so was not targeted.
  So they would stay good, at least until another evil player chooses them first in the night.

          <p>Nothing.

          <p>
  Since the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> is in play the attempted character change fails.
  Additionally, the <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span> does not become drunk and there is no possible alignment flip for the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>
  since this requires the actual <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> player to be chosen, as in to be actively pointed to by another player.

  If the <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span> had attempted to turn the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> into the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> then, as the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> has been pointed to, there would have been drunkenness and potential alignment flipping.

          <p>
  The game ended at the point when the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> was executed and the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> did not have the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> ability.
  This results in a final two where the Demon is alive, so an evil win,
  that is then flipped by the only <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> ability in play to a good win.
  There was no period of time between the execution and the game ending for the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> to gain the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> ability,
  giving rise to two <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> abilities that cancel each other out, making win conditions normal again.
        </p>
          <p>
  This is a reasonable interpretation, but as there is no definitive ruling

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Because otherwise in a base two Outsiders game with the <span class="Minion">Baron</span> and only four Outsiders on the script,

        <div class="answer">
          <p>No.
        </p>
          <p>
  The ST has control over the kills when the <span class="Demon">Ojo</span> picks an out of play character so can simulate what would happen in a <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> game,
  by choosing to sink the kill into a dead player after the second attack in a non-<span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> game.
        </p>
          <p>
  The first time the <span class="Demon">Ojo</span> attacks the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span>, a player dies:
<ul><li>
   when the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> is in play, the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> dies.
</li><li>
   when the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> is out of play, the ST should kill an arbitrary player.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  The second time the <span class="Demon">Ojo</span> attacks the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span>, no one dies:
<ul><li>
   when the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> is in play, there is no death, since a dead character cannot die again;
</li><li>
   when the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> is out of play, the ST should sink the kill.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  With the outcome the same for both the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> and non-<span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> game there is no confirmation for the <span class="Demon">Ojo</span>.

  It is legal to add an extra Outsider on top of the base count,

  The <span class="Townsfolk">Monk</span> protected player is safe from the Demon,

  The <span class="Minion">Scarlet Woman</span> must become the new Demon if their ability is active (alive, not drunk or poisoned, 5+ alive players),

          <p>Yes.

          <p>
  Each alive <span class="Demon">Legion</span> ability can kill one player and multiple <span class="Demon">Legion</span> abilities can be activated at night.
  So there can be a number of kills up to the number of active <span class="Demon">Legion</span>,
  though <span class="Demon">Legion</span> should usually never kill more than two, and if they do multi-kill it should be multiple Legions.
  Multi-kill is usually done to simulate other Demons or Minion abilities or to support a world pushed by the Legions.
  For example, if a <span class="Demon">Legion</span> is bluffing <span class="Townsfolk">Gossip</span> and asks the ST to kill an extra player tonight, the ST will typically comply and kill one more <span class="Demon">Legion</span>.

  Evil wins because the ET ability win condition of the Good Twin being executed while the ET lives trumps the good team's regular win condition of no living Demons.

          <p>
  The LM not moving could be a problem on N1 seeing as the SC acts after the babysitter is decided.

   the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> is flipped / stays good;

   the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> is drunk, so the ST deceives them that their ability, that they believe they are the Demon, is still working;

          <p>
  When a player is drunk or poisoned, they are deceived into believing that their ability is working normally.
  The first part of the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s ability is a "you think" ability, which means deceiving the player about what they are.

  So nothing has changed.
        </p>
          <p>
  However, drunkenness or poisoning does shut down the other mechanical part of their ability,

  One possible way to avoid this scenario:
<ol><li>
   When preparing the bag the ST places two Minion tokens and no Demon token.

   Choose two adjacent players who drew good tokens to be the Demon and the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>.

   Give the Demon the character that they drew as one of their bluffs, to avoid giving them a free fourth bluff

  The <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span>'s ability prevents Minions and Demons from knowing each other.
  When the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> dies, 
  the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span>, if they were sufficiently mad, gains the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> ability,
  so Minions and Demons are not allowed to know each other until the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span> dies.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The <span class="Minion">Spy</span> is the marked player and they must die.
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span> is shown the character that the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> misregistered as, which can either be in play or out of play.
  When the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> dies, the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span> who was sufficiently mad about being the character that they saw gains the ability if alive, sober and healthy.
  If the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> dies misregistering as another character the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span> is unaffected.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>During setup the ST will have marked one of the VIs with the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span> reminder token - this is the VI that needs to die in order to turn the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span>.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>The ST shows the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span> any character token, which most likely will be out of play.
  Then an arbitrary player is marked who can be evil, but it is probably best it is not the Demon.
  If at the time of the marked player's death the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span> is alive, sober and healthy and has been sufficiently mad as the shown character,
  they gain the ability.
  So as far as the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span> is concerned, the character of the token that they see is important, not the character of the marked player.

  They are still woken, because this is important for characters such as the <span class="Townsfolk">Chambermaid</span>, and prompted to use their ability as usual.
  They are not told that no one is dead at their point in the night order as this would be giving them too much information,

          <p>This depends on who the Lycan and the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> pick each night.
  Note that the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> still poisons a player every night after the Lycan pick.
        </p>
          <p>
  On any night when the Lycan successfully kills a good player,

  the Lycan protection is in effect:
  after the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> picks another player to poison, the previously poisoned player cannot die, and they become healthy.

          <p>
  On a night that the Lycan kills a good player and the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> then happens to pick the Lycan to poison,

  Any night when the <span class="Townsfolk">Lycanthrope</span> does not successfully kill,

  there is no Lycan protection so the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> functions normally:

  The <span class="Demon">Lil' Monsta</span> adds +1 Minion because the Monsta token does not actually go into the bag; the extra Minion is dealt so that there are the correct number of evil players.
  In the case of <span class="Demon">Riot</span>, the correct number of evil tokens go into the bag because the ST adds that many <span class="Demon">Riot</span> tokens, so there is no need to add an extra Minion.

          <p>In the case of a <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span> and a <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span> with the <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span> ability both in play,

        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span>-SC acts first and becomes the Demon, 
  then the old Demon becomes a self-poisoned <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span> and the actual SC becomes sober
  (since the Philo causing them to be drunk is no longer in play; we have a new instance of the Philo).
  Now the <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span> can also choose the new Demon (the game's starting Philo) and swap to the Demon.
        </p>
          <p>
  So it is possible for the starting <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span> to become the evil Demon and then the good self-poisoned <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span>.
  If that happens then the starting Demon would become the self-poisoned <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span>, and remain as such after the second snake charming which will have no affect on them.

          <p>
  Depending on the kind of game the ST likes to run and the group likes to experience,

          <p>ST choice; it could go either way.

          <p>
  Two actions that occur at dusk would attempt to happen at the same time:
<ul><li>
   At dusk tomorrow, all players made drunk by the <span class="Townsfolk">Minstrel</span> become sober; the ST removes the EVERYONE IS DRUNK reminder.  
</li><li>
   Each dusk, if no player was executed today, the game ends and the evil team wins.

          <p>
  This is an order of operations issue.  Whichever happens first loses the interaction.
        </p>
          <p>
  One interpretation:
  The <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> will be drunk until dusk. 
  The day ends with no execution, then dusk happens, so the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> is still drunk at the point they otherwise would have won.
  They do not become sober until that start of the night phase.
  The game continues.
        </p>
          <p>
  Alternative interpretation:
  First the <span class="Townsfolk">Minstrel</span>'s tokens are removed, then the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> wincon is checked - evil wins.
        </p>
          <p>
  Given that the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> was drunk up until literally that moment, arguably it makes more intuitive sense that they would fail to win the game.

  This interaction is not universally loved so is commonly:

    the Demon will still have to learn non-Minions as their Minions but will at least know their info is wrong.

  It would therefore be valid for the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span>'s jump to be processed as per usual,

  In full, the ST's options are:

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Either. The way <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span> arbitrary deaths works is that the ST can block any kills (or not), and can cause new kills originating from the <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span>.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The ST can allow the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> to jump.
        </p>
          <p>
  ..ST's options are as follows, assuming the new <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> chooses an Outsider when deaths are arbitrary:
        </p>
          <p>
  If the new <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> targets an Outsider then, since deaths are arbitrary, the choices are:
<ol><li>
   the chosen Outsider is PH protected and does not die;
</li><li>
   the chosen Outsider is PH protected and does not die, but then is PH killed, so no jump;
</li><li>
   the chosen Outsider dies to the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span>, so the jump happens.
</li></ol></p>
          <p>
  "Deaths are arbitrary" means the ST can allows deaths go go through, or not go through.
  So if the ST allows the Demon's choice to go through, that one is an attack from the Demon, not the PH,
  and if the ST blocks it, then it is treated similarly to the player being protected from the Demon that night.
  Any "additional" deaths are considered attacks from the PH.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The Demon should be shown three characters that are safe for her to bluff as, to avoid double claiming a good player.
  These characters should:
<ul><li>
   be any combination of Townsfolk and Outsiders; two Townsfolk and one Outsider is pretty common,
</li><li>
   out of play
</li><li>
   not be Minions; bluffs must be <em>good</em> characters
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  It is strongly recommended that whatever characters the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> or the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> believe themself to be are not given as bluffs;
  although out of play, the Demon might not appreciate receiving these!
  Additionally, some STs would consider it illegal to do so; the argument is that the Demon should see three out of play <em>tokens</em>.
  But if the group is experienced it could be attempted, perhaps to signal to the Demon who the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> is.

          <p>

  The ST can decide whether to show just one Demon player or all living Demon players to the Traveller, since all living Demons are defined to be "the Demon".

  As with all unclear rulings, the ST should choose one, ensure players know how they handle it and be consistent.

          <p>No, players only learn when they <em>are</em> mad.

          <p>
  If a player is informed of madness and then the madness ends that same night they are not informed,

        <div class="answer">
          <p>No.

          <p>
  "Madness" is a Clocktower term that means "trying to convince people of something".
  Some characters like the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span> interact with madness,
  but an ability that interacts with madness is not needed to be mad.
  Anybody who is trying to convince players of anything in the game is being mad,
  so the statement "no players are currently mad" will always be false!
        </p>
          <p>

          <p>Yes.

  Nominating dead players is common when the Demon is suspected to be the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> or the <span class="Demon">Zombuul</span>.

          <p>
  The game defines public as "anything said or done in such a way that most players, as well as the Storyteller, know that it happened."
  It is not enough to say "I use my ability on X";
  no one can know what has happened if a player does not state their character, so they have to claim what ability is being used.
        </p>
          <p>

          <p>They can ask, but the ST is only required to tell them if it has changed,

        <h4 class="question">Does a player who is resurrected / regurgitated then immediately killed again learn this?

        <div class="answer">
          <p>No, most of the time.
        </p>
          <p>
  The player is not informed, nor is there an announcement in the morning, since the ST only announces visible changes to a player's life/death status.
  So any player who is revived and killed in the same night is unlikely to learn this.
  Any "you start knowing" characters will be dead before they get to use their ability again,
  while any "when you learn that you are dead" abilties do not apply, since the players have not relearnt this.
        </p>
          <p>
  However, abilities that trigger on death might be triggered, so:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Ravenkeeper</span> getting another use of their ability may surmise that they were revived and killed in the same night;
</li><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Sage</span> getting two new players would likely figure out that they were revived and then killed by a Demon in the same night.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>ST choice. 
        </p>
          <p>
  For example a resurrected <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> is treated as a new <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> and can get a new grandchild.
  If a new one is assigned, only the new grandchild being killed by the Demon triggers her death.
  Additionally, the new grandchild could be dead, protecting the <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> from being able to trigger their own death.
        </p>
          <p>
  For other first night info characters, if the info has not changed, they should technically be wakened and given the same info.
  It matters for several reasons, including droison, dying later, or being checked by the <span class="Townsfolk">Chambermaid</span>.

  The game ends as soon as an end condition is met, which can occur before a character ability has fully resolved.
  With just two players left alive the game ends so the game can end in the middle of the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span>'s picks,
  which, as with the other multi-kill Demons, happen in order.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> chooses the three living players with herself last, she is guaranteed to win as long as she says "live":
  If any of the two players before her say die, they die immediately and the game is over with only two players left alive, evil wins.
  If all say "live" then they die in order, so the first player dies leaving just two players left alive, the game is over and evil wins.
        </p>
          <p>
  If, instead to be safe, the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> chooses the other two living players and a dead player,
  then if anyone says die the game is over,
  and if they all choose live, then they all die and, again, the game is over.
        </p>
          <p>
  The ST still needs to prompt the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> for her picks because she could still mess up,
  by choosing dead players that then resurrect:
  a dead pick will say live and at least one of the other picks will say die so the game continues because there are now still more than two alive.
        </p>
          <p>
  It is of course also possible for the living player picked with two dead players to mess up,
  as should they pick die then the game instantly ends, no matter what the dead players pick.

          <p>Evil wins.

          <p>
  Since all three are alive at the end of their choices, all three will die in the order chosen.
  Assuming that there is no protection the first two picks die then,
  because there are only two players left alive before the Demon is scheduled to die,
  evil immediately wins.

  Evil wins when there are two players alive, and unless an ability says otherwise such as the <span class="Minion">Mastermind</span> or the <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span>,

  does the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> and the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span> stuff still happen?

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes, in the order that they were picked.
        </p>
          <p>
  The players would die in the order the Al-Had chose them,
  with any on death abilities handled as they trigger,
  but the ST will end the game as soon as end game condition is met, 
  such as only two players left alive.
  So if the choices were the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span>, the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span>, and another role in that order,
  the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span> would die and someone would become the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span>,
  then the player who was the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> would die and the game would end. 
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> were first,
  the Al-Had would be offered the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> swap,
  and if they swapped themself then the rest of the kills would not happen.
  If they instead swapped the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> with the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span>,
  then the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span> would not trigger and instead there would be another <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> swap.
  Theoretically there could be three <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> swaps.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Maybe.
        </p>
          <p>
  Usually when a Minion learns that they are now the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>, they are waking due to the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>'s ability rather than their own.
  In which case they are very definitely not waking to their own ability so do not register to the <span class="Townsfolk">Chambermaid</span>.
        </p>
          <p>
  However, the SW's ability is about becoming the Demon should the previous one die for any reason,
  so arguably it is their own ability causing them to wake to learn that they are now the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>,
  thus registering to the <span class="Townsfolk">Chambermaid</span>.
        </p>
          <p>
  A reasonable way to run this interaction is to therefore ask why the SW is becoming the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>:
<ul><li>
   if the SW is the only option (single Minion game / other Minions are dead) then the ST could rule that it is the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>'s ability turning the SW;
</li><li>
   if the SW is not the only option but is prioritised ahead of another Minion who would have been turned then they have turned due to their own SW ability;
</li><li>
   if the SW is not the only option but happens to be picked ahead of any other Minion then it is reasonable to treat that as the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>'s ability turning them.

          <p>No.
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span> is targeting a player by way of choosing a character - only the player with that character token could possibly become <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span> drunk.
  This can be treated as though the ability is pointing at the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>, even though the player is not.
  However, the <span class="Minion">Cerenovus</span> is not choosing the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> in the same sense; they are not interacting with the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> player just by pointing at <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> on the character list.

          <p>If the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span> points to the unpicked <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> (or a player with the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> ability)
  then, no matter what character they are gambled as, 
  the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span> becomes drunk
  and the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> turns or remains the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span>'s alignment.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span> gambles another player as the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>, the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> has no effect on the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span>.

  So the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span> pointing to the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> on the script is treated differently to the <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span> doing same.
  The rationale for this is that the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span>'s guessing a player as a character is not targeting the player with that character,
  whereas the <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span> is effectively picking a player via their character

  Interestingly the <span class="Traveller">Gunslinger</span>'s ability refers to the first vote that has been tallied, not the first nomination of the day.
  So if in a non <span class="Traveller">Butcher</span> game the first nomination of the day happens to be on the <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span> resulting in an execution,
  no votes would be tallied, as the vote on the <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span> would be skipped,

  However, the <span class="Traveller">Butcher</span> in play allows for a second nomination where the votes <em>are</em> counted,

          <p>
  The <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> does not have the <span class="Townsfolk">Atheist</span> ability so the game proceeds as if there were no <span class="Townsfolk">Atheist</span>.
  Execution of the ST without an <span class="Townsfolk">Atheist</span> ability in play means evil wins,

  The living <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span> with the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> ability would make the in play <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> drunk,
  so, with only one active <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> ability win conditions are flipped.
  But once the Philo dies, both <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> abilities would become active,
  since the Philo always retains an "even while dead" ability assuming no drunkenness or poisoning.
  Two active <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> abilities would then cancel each other out,
  making win conditions normal again.
        </p>
          <p>
  Should the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> gain the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> ability

          <p>The <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> flips the winning team after the game has ended.

  For example, in a final three of the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span>, the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> and the <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span> the day ends without execution results in an evil win:
  No execution with three alive with both <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> and <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span> in play means a good character win condition competing with an evil character win condition, so good wins.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes, but this is discouraged since it can lead to the ST controlling the kills:
<ul><li>
   the ST chooses a kill for the fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> and informs the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>, 
</li><li>
   the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> attacks the fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s target to keep up the lie,
</li><li>
   the Demon attacks the same target to keep up the lie.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  The ST can do this if their group is cool with the idea
  or perhaps to ensure seeing the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> token does not confirm someone as the Demon.
        </p>
          <p>
  It is possible to simulate the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> to the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> without dictating the kills by having the actual Demon be the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span>,
  and the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> believe that they are a Demon that does not make a N1 choice, such as the <span class="Demon">Po</span>.
  The ST places both Demon tokens in the bag, remembering that the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> is the real Demon, and showing each to the other as their <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>.
  Since the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> kills out of sync, who they poison each night can be shown to the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> as the fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> pick for the following night.
  Then when the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> picks the same player to kill, the timing of the pick's death to the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> will sync with the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s expectations.
  The Demon never knows what Demon their <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> believes themself to be,
  so the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> will not be aware that their fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> is the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span>.

  (This is similar to how the <span class="Townsfolk">Monk</span> protecting the <span class="Demon">Lleech</span> host does not remove the <span class="Demon">Lleech</span>'s host effect but the host is temporarily healthy.

  Think of registering as: if an ability "asks" a player about their character or alignment or living status, they can "answer" with something other than what they are.
  Misregistering can never change the game directly (like executing someone).
  It can however trick someone else's ability into doing it for them,
  like the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> who nominates the <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span> - the <span class="Minion">Spy</span>'s ability cannot kill themself, but it can trick the <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span>'s ability into thinking they are a Townsfolk,

        <div class="answer">
          <p>All <span class="Demon">Riot</span> players register as Demons so they all learn who the <span class="Townsfolk">King</span> is.

  This jinx is on the <span class="Townsfolk">King</span> rather than the <span class="Townsfolk">Choirboy</span> to draw <span class="Demon">Riot</span>’s attention to the fact that it is nominating the <span class="Townsfolk">King</span> that will trigger the jinx, not nominating the <span class="Townsfolk">Choirboy</span>.

          <p>Maybe.

          <p>
  Whether it is definitely allowed by the rules is unclear, since cases can be made both ways.

        </p>

  Since the <span class="Townsfolk">Savant</span> must receive two statements, one true and one false,
  then if the ST is of the opinion that misregistration can affect the <span class="Townsfolk">Savant</span>'s statements
  then interestingly, since the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> / <span class="Minion">Spy</span> can register differently to different parts of the same ability,
  their registration is allowed to be different for both statements,
  such as registering as evil for one statement and good for the other.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The ST should wait until the start of the next night phase to inform them of their new character.
  The SW's position in the night order is really just a reminder in case the ST forgets to inform them that they are now the Demon after the previous Demon died during the day.

          <p>Yes, but this is probably a bad idea.

          <p>
  The <span class="Minion">Spy</span> misregistering as a good character can cause her:

   to die instead when the <span class="Demon">Ojo</span> targets any good character.
</li><li>
   to survive if the <span class="Demon">Ojo</span> targets the <span class="Minion">Spy</span>, causing an <span class="Demon">Ojo</span> miss so the ST picks the kill(s).
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  But note:
<ul><li>
   if the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> does register as the intended target there is still only one death, so the ST could not kill off both the actual target and the <span class="Minion">Spy</span>.
</li><li>
   the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> could still register as the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> and be killed by the <span class="Demon">Ojo</span>.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  This logic also works with the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span>:
<ul><li>
   picking any evil character can kill the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> instead
</li><li>
   picking the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> can have the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> misregister and therefore survive, again causing an <span class="Demon">Ojo</span> miss so the ST picks the kill(s).

   the Grimoire with just one or two small changes to throw off what the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> thinks the game state is.

  Since showing her the correct Grimoire works against the idea of the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> malfunctioning,

          <p>An execution requires the majority of living players to vote and to have the most votes of the day,

  While players dying can lower the number of votes required:

   any nomination still needs to have more votes than any other in order to put someone on the block,

  For example, if player X gets five votes and that is not enough and then players die or travel away meaning five would be enough now, player X is still safe:

          <p>
  The trigger for the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span> and the <span class="Outsider">Moonchild</span> is learning that they have died,

        </p>

  The ST only ever announces changes in life status,

        </p>

          <p>Most of the time it makes sense to register the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> as evil to poison the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> and deceive them with whatever makes sense.
  But as the <span class="Minion">Spy</span>'s ability to register as good is separate to their ability to register as a Townsfolk or an Outsider,
  there are a lot of options available to the ST.
        </p>
          <p>
  Should the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> register as a good Townsfolk to the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span>,
  then, for as long as they register as such,
  the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> would have that Townsfolk's ability.
  For example, the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> could:
<ul><li>
   get a gossip kill in;
</li><li>
   register as the <span class="Townsfolk">Nightwatchman</span> to another player;
</li><li>
   become Solider safe from the Demon tonight;
</li><li>
   grant <span class="Townsfolk">Monk</span> protection to another player ...

          <p>
  If the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> registered as the good <span class="Minion">Spy</span> to the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span>
  then the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> would see an accurate Grimoire,
  which would be pretty wild idea and not recommended!
  But a potentially fun and interesting move is to have the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> register as the <em>evil</em> <span class="Minion">Spy</span>,
  allowing the ST to show an altered version of the Grimoire instead.

  The ST is not the group so does not need to be convinced privately by a mad player.

          <p>If the character has setup abilities that could change the Outsiders (<span class="Townsfolk">Balloonist</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Huntsman</span>)
  then it should be decided that they will be the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> before tokens go in the bag,

  This decision cannot then change after token distribution,
  to avoid an illegal setup.

          <p>
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Bounty Hunter</span> can be made the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> after tokens are drawn,
  because the <span class="Townsfolk">Bounty Hunter</span>'s setup effect does not actually require the Storyteller to change what tokens are going into the bag.
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Bounty Hunter</span>'s setup effect is simply waking a Townsfolk and telling them that they are evil,
  so in the case of the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> BH the ST just does not wake up a Townsfolk to tell them that they are evil.
        </p>
          <p>
  Otherwise it is up to the ST.
  Most STs assign the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> once tokens have been handed out and know the Grimoire, allowing them to balance the game much better.
  The entry for the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> states "while preparing the first night", which would be once tokens are already handed out.
  But it is also fine for the ST to decide beforehand to make the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> a specific character regardless of token distribution.

        <h4 class="question">How does the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> interact with drunkenness and poisoning?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>This depends on the timing, since there are two parts to the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span>'s ability:
<ol><li>
   the N1 suppression of information;
</li><li>
   their death triggering Minions and Demons learning each other.
</li></ol></p>
          <p>
  On N1 the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> acts early in the night,
  so for drunkenness / poisoning to have any effect the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> would need to <em>start</em> the game drunk or poisoned via a setup effect such as:
<ul><li>
   neighbourng the <span class="Demon">No Dashii</span>;
</li><li><span class="Outsider">Puzzlemaster</span> drunkenness;
</li><li>
   being <em>the</em> <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span>.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  Any of these causes would mean that the regular Minion and Demon info steps are performed
  while other sources of drunkenness and poisoning act after the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> so will not impact her ability.
        </p>
          <p>
  After N1
  drunkenness and poisoning benefits the good team
  since it deactivates the second part of the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> ability:
  if the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> dies while drunk or poisoned,
  the evil team never learns each other.
  Note that the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span>'s death is still the trigger here: 
  if the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> does not die then any drunkenness or poisoning is irrelevant.

          <p>Yes, unless there is another active <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> ability in play,

          <p>This will depend on what the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> registers as.

  If the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> misregisters to the <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span> as a Demon,
  then they could swap,
  with the SC becoming whatever Demon on the script the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> registered as

  Both players should be woken to learn their new character.
        </p>
          <p>
  Since the SC ability causes alignments to be swapped
  then whether the new Demon is good or evil would also depend on if the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> registered to the SC as good or evil.
  Players always learn if their alignment changes so the SC would learn their new alignment if it changed.
  The <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> would not learn anything about their alignment,
  since it will not have changed,
  unless for some reason the previous SC was already evil.
        </p>
          <p>
  The SC will probably believe that they hit the Demon while the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> will not be sure what happened,

          <p>
  The ST points to the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> and one other player and shows them any Townsfolk token.

        </p>
          <p>
  When the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> is one of the players shown to the <span class="Townsfolk">Washerwoman</span>, the shown character is allowed to be:
<ol><li>
   out of play,
</li><li>
   the in play character of the non-<span class="Minion">Spy</span> player in the shown pair,
</li><li>
   the in play character of another player, not shown to the <span class="Townsfolk">Washerwoman</span>.

        <h4 class="question">Can players pick Travellers with their abilities?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes, if the ability just states player any player is valid.
        </p>
          <p>
  Any abilities that do not allow Travellers being chosen will specify it,
  such as the <span class="Townsfolk">Dreamer</span>'s ability which states "not Travellers".
        </p>
          <p>
  Character changing abilities (<span class="Outsider">Barber</span> / <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span> / <span class="Minion">Summoner</span> /...) are a special case.
  The default rule is that Travelers cannot become non-Travelers and any ability that would try to change their character gets a headshake no and a prompt to choose again.
  There is an optional rule that Travellers can become non-Travellers so if the ST, the group and the Traveller are okay with it then the swap can happen,
  but if it was not discussed prior to the game start then it is best to not allow it,
  or only allow Travellers to become other Travellers.

          <p>The <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> is told that they are one of the Demons on the script and asked to make any choices if applicable.
  Some STs will confirm that they are still good, but RAW this is unnecessary.
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> is not given any bluffs or shown any Minions as that only happens N1.
  The Demon is informed that the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> player is their <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>, and learns who they chose,

          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> asks what character they are at any point while they have the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> ability,
  they should be told that they are the Demon that they were shown.

          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> loses the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> ability through a further execution,
  then they are treated exactly as they would have been had that execution occurred without a <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> execution beforehand.
  They are not told about no longer being a Demon but if they ask what character they are, they should be told that they are the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span>,

          <p>"Good character" and "evil character" actually have definitions in the game that are not about the alignment of the player:

   "Good" characters are Townsfolk and Outsiders - blue tokens.
</li><li>
   "Evil" characters are Demons and Minions - red tokens.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  So the <span class="Townsfolk">Dreamer</span> is always shown a Townsfolk / Outsider for one character and a Minion / Demon for the other:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Bounty Hunter</span> / <span class="Minion">Mezepheles</span> turned Townsfolk is still <span class="Townsfolk">Dreamer</span> seen as that Townsfolk token correctly or any Minion/Demon token incorrectly, even though they are now evil;

          <p>
  The <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span> always knows the character of their Good Twin, so should be immediately informed if it changes (<span class="Outsider">Barber</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span> / <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span> / ...).

          <p>They are told that they are now a Demon from the script.
  They do not learn any Minion info, as that only happens N1,

  They can learn fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">King</span> info.
        </p>
          <p>
  They are not told anything about their alignment
  since RAW players only learn their alignment after it changes,
  which also means that when the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>, or the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>, changes character they do not learn their true alignment as it never changed.
        </p>

  Character swaps essentially reset the characters; they are replaced with new instances of the characters.

          <p>Yes.

  The order of the kills is important: as long as the player causing the drunkenness dies before the drunk player, then the drunk player becomes sober.
        </p>
          <p>
  For example, the Philo-drunkenness is removed if the <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span> dies before the original of the character.
  So if the Philo-<span class="Townsfolk">Ravenkeeper</span> and the <span class="Townsfolk">Ravenkeeper</span> both died in that order on the same night then they would both get sober info.

  Either a player dies as soon as they choose to die

  they each die in the order chosen.
        </p>
          <p>
  This is important for abilties that activate on death (<span class="Townsfolk">Banshee</span> / <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Ravenkeeper</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Sage</span>)
  as RAW these are triggered as soon as the corresponding player dies,
  interrupting any further annoucements or deaths due to the Al-Had.
  Note that there is disagreement over this interpretation.
  But interruptions only matter in some cases such as when players may swap character or determining which of the dead players was announced as the <span class="Townsfolk">Banshee</span>,
  while postponing some triggered abilities has no effect such as when a player learns information.

          <p>No.
  There is no active ability letting players know the <span class="Demon">Leviathan</span>'s state,

          <p>Yes.

  The ST is already lying to the player that they are the Demon,

        </p>
          <p>
  Anything on the script that could happen or be told to the Demon can be simulated for the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>:
<ul><li>
   fake <span class="Townsfolk">Magician</span>, by showing an extra "Minion"

  The ST is also free to give the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> correct info when these characters are really in play,

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes.

          <p>
  It was previously thought not, but since the ruling that the <span class="Townsfolk">Fortune Teller</span>'s Red Herring yields a 'no' in a <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> game,
  the consensus is that this implies that the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> can flip information after accounting for any form of misregistration.
        </p>
          <p>
  For example:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Empath</span> sat between a good player and the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> registering as good should ordinarily receive a zero, but the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> can flip this to a one, which is true info.
</li><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Chef</span> seeing the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> as evil can see a pair when there are in fact no pairs in the game, but the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> can flip this to zero pairs, again true info.
</li><li>
   the VI who checks the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> registering as good or the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> registering as evil will have their incorrect info flipped by the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> so learns their true alignments.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  This is a controversial interaction, so the ST is free to rule differently, they just need to make sure their players now how they are running it.

  Some STs rule that after taking into account mis-registration, the information is reversed, so that,

<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Fortune Teller</span> is told a 'no' on their Red Herring;
</li><li>
   the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> misregistering as evil, would be seen as good to alignment checkers (<span class="Townsfolk">Cult Leader</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Empath</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Village Idiot</span> / ...).

          <p>
  Drunkenness, poisoning or dead players bluffing their character may lead to players not having an ability that they think they have.
  If the incorrect belief is due to another player lying then the ST will probably respond that they do not have the ability.
  If it is the case that the player was drunk or poisoned at the time they 'gained' the ability,
  but are currently sober and healthy as they try to use it,
  then the ST would have no option but to inform them that they do not have that ability.
  But if they are still drunk or poisoned then the ST will usually give an arbitrary answer, 
  but it is also legal to tell the player that they do not have that ability,
  perhaps to make them believe that they are currently sober and healthy <em>now</em> and only drunk / poisoned when they should have gained the ability.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>RAW, just their new character.
        </p>
          <p>
  It is game mechanics that players always know what character they are and their alignment
  and that they are only informed of <em>changes</em> to either.
  However, the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> and the Mario have abilities that allow the ST to deceive them,
  and when the ability is lost upon a character change the deception is no longer permitted and the affected player must learn their new character,
  including, hilariously, when swapped to the character that they thought they already were.
        </p>
          <p>
  But they are not told of an alignment change
  since crucially it has not changed:
  the good, former <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> who believes that they are evil would still be good, while the evil, former <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> who believes that they are good would remain evil.
  They may still believe they are the opposite alignment or they may be utterly confused,
  especially if the were turned into the character that they already believed themself to be.
  Should the affected player ask the ST what their alignment is
  then they should be told something like "your alignment has not changed".
  An exception can be made for an inexperienced player, where it might be helpful for the ST to tell them their alignment.
  With this understood, some STs still choose to always tell a player their alignment when they are changed from/to a Demon/Minion.
        </p>
          <p>
  Some further considerations:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> actually turned evil via a <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> jump must be informed that they are now the evil <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span>;
</li><li>
   the evil <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>, who believes themself to be a good Townsfolk,
    will learn that they are the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>, after the previous <span class="Demon">Imp</span> self-kills, but are told nothing about their alignment as it has not changed;
</li><li>
   the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> turned into an evil Demon by the <span class="Minion">Summoner</span> will learn that they are now evil.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>No, they are announced as the <span class="Minion">Vizier</span>.
  The "everyone knows who you are" refers to the <em>ability</em> they have.

          <p>
  When the <span class="Townsfolk">Alchemist</span> is on the script,

          <p>
  Note that as per the jinx the <span class="Townsfolk">Alchemist</span> <span class="Minion">Vizier</span> may only choose to execute immediately if three or more players voted, regardless of those players' alignment;
  if they opt to enforce the execution when fewer than three players have voted
  then it is a similar situation to the <span class="Outsider">Butler</span> voting without their master or the <span class="Outsider">Golem</span> nominating a second time:
  potentially a pardonable accident or deliberate cheating that the group will have to handle accordingly.

        <h4 class="question">Who should the ST kill when the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> triggers?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>It is going to be very specific to the exact characters in play and alive.
  Some general guidelines and ideas:
<ul><li>
   In most cases, leave the Demon alive in the final three, otherwise the game ends in good's favour using a Minion ability.
</li><li>
   The Demon can be killed if there is an <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span> pair both still alive, leaving the choice for town to choose between the two twins with a non-Demon third player.
</li><li>
   The final three cannot be the Twins and the Demon as that is an automatic evil win.
</li><li>
   It is a bad idea to leave hard-confirmed characters alive in final three.
    A final three that includes the proc'd <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span> and the <span class="Townsfolk">Professor</span> who resurrected a dead player would be unfair on evil who managed to get their <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> executed.
</li><li>
   If the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span> killed by the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> chose a player between executions, the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span>-picked player can be left alive to cast suspicion on the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span> claim.
</li><li>
   There is no mechanical problem to leave only evil left alive in final three as the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> kill does not require a nomination,
    just the pointing, but this can be very hard on good to have to work out exactly which of the evil players is actually the Demon.
</li><li>
   There are some abilities that can prevent the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> coming down to a final three and instead having four or even five left alive. 
    While this can be interesting, it should be used sparingly, as it soft-confirms a few players
    (the player claiming <span class="Townsfolk">Sailor</span> or <span class="Townsfolk">Fool</span> is almost certainly good / the <span class="Townsfolk">Tea Lady</span> and their neighbours / ... ).

          <p>
  In order for their ability to trigger, the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> must be targeted by a <em>player</em>.
  Since the ST is not a player,
  the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>'s ability goes untriggered
  meaning no drunkenness or alignment changing is possible.

          <p>No, their only choice is to kill no one or one player on their first night.
  Choices or lack thereof as their previous character have no effect on their current character,

        <h4 class="question">What happens when a multi-kill Demon (<span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> / <span class="Demon">Po</span> / <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span>) picks a protected player?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>This will likely depend on the source of the protection and the order of the Demon's picks. 
        </p>
          <p>
  If that player is protected due to their own ability (sober <span class="Townsfolk">Sailor</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Soldier</span>) then they cannot die no matter who else dies that night.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the protection is due to another player (<span class="Townsfolk">Innkeeper</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Monk</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Tea Lady</span>) then that player cannot die, as long as source of the protection remains alive.
  This means who and the order of the Demon's picks is important:
<ul><li>
   If the source was not selected by the Demon, the protected player cannot die.
</li><li>
   If the source was selected after the protected player, the protected player survives but then the source, barring any other forms of protection, will die.
</li><li>
   If the source was selected before, then on their death (which includes choosing to die to the Al-Had), the protection is removed,
    and the target of their protection is no longer safe.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  In the case of the Al-Had,
  all picks are publicly announced and the players still have to make a choice
  and if all three players choose live,
  or all three are alive at the end of their choices,
  then all three die in the order that they were selected.
  Again, the order of death matters: the protected player survives if the source of the protection was picked afterwards (or not at all).

          <p>Yes, with some exceptions.
        </p>
          <p>
  The new Demon is treated as a new instance of the Demon so,
  most of the time, all of the previous Demon's reminder tokens can be safely removed.
  For example:
<ul><li>
   the ex-<span class="Demon">Pukka</span>'s previously poisoned player becomes healthy and is no longer scheduled to die, potentially causing a night of no deaths;
</li><li>
   any Minions killed by the ex-<span class="Demon">Vigormortis</span> lose their abilities and no longer poison a Townsfolk neighbour;
</li><li>
   the previous <span class="Demon">Lleech</span> host becomes healthy;
</li><li>
   the <span class="Demon">No Dashii</span>'s Townsfolk neighbours become healthy;
</li><li>
   the new <span class="Demon">Po</span> does not get three attacks if the previous <span class="Demon">Po</span> had charged;
</li><li>
   the previous <span class="Demon">Yaggababble</span>’s potential kills do not carry over to the new <span class="Demon">Yaggababble</span>.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  However:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span>'s 'once' token, if present, remains in the centre of the Grimoire as this is global and nothing in the game can remove this;
</li><li>
   the <span class="Demon">Leviathan</span>'s day reminders are not reset as the day count is universal.

        <h4 class="question">Do choices made by a character while drunk or poisoned take effect if that character later becomes sober and healthy?

  otherwise choices made while drunk or poisoned malfunction, which registers to the <span class="Townsfolk">Mathematician</span>, and have no effect on the gamestate.
        </p>
          <p>
  Physically the ST records the choices made by characters by placing reminder tokens in the Grimoire.
  However, choices made while drunk or poisoned do not cause reminder tokens to be placed.
  Consequently the character becoming sober and healthy is immaterial;
  their ability is unable to have any effect since their no players were marked.
        </p>
          <p>
  Examples include:
<ul><li>
   the Demon, made drunk by the <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span>, attacks a player who is not marked to die and does not die even though the <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span> later dies to the <span class="Townsfolk">Gossip</span>;
</li><li>
   the <span class="Minion">Devil's Advocate</span>, made drunk by the <span class="Townsfolk">Innkeeper</span>, fails to protect their Demon, who will still not be safe from execution tomorrow even when the <span class="Townsfolk">Innkeeper</span> dies tonight;
</li><li>
   the <span class="Minion">Devil's Advocate</span> picks the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> and becomes drunk, so no protection token is placed,
    then even though the DA becomes sober when the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> is transformed (<span class="Outsider">Barber</span> / <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span>) the ex <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> is not safe from execution tomorrow;
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  The exception is for backwards-checking abilities
  where reminder tokens are always placed
  and drunkenness and poisoning only checked for when the ability would do something.

          <p>They learn:
<ul><li>
   what Demon they are;
</li><li>
   that they are evil, if their alignment was changed.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  Additionally they are told if applicable:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">King</span>,
</li><li>
   the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>,
</li><li>
   the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>, along with any picks that they make each night.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  The <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>, the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> and the <span class="Townsfolk">King</span> are all "the Demon knows who you are" abilities,
  so the new Demon learns any that are currently in play and alive, sober and healthy that they have not previously been informed of.
        </p>
          <p>
  The new Demon does not learn any bluffs or the Minions, as this info was given in the Demon info step which already happened,
  unless it was skipped because of an in play <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span>,
  in which case all Minions and Demons learn each other when the last sober and healthy PG ability dies.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Their ability does not trigger.
        </p>
          <p>
  The <span class="Demon">Pukka</span>'s kills always die poisoned.
  This is what allows the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> to kill characters such as the <span class="Townsfolk">Fool</span>, <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span> or <span class="Townsfolk">Sailor</span>, who might otherwise survive thanks to their own ability.
        </p>
          <p>
  But dying poisoned also means that effects which trigger upon death are disabled meaning for example that:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> is not offered the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> swap when the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> dies
</li><li>
   a good player does not become drunk when the <span class="Outsider">Sweetheart</span> dies
</li><li>
   the ST does not get an out of play Minion ability when the <span class="Outsider">Plague Doctor</span> dies
</li><li>
   the evil players do not get to switch their roles when the <span class="Outsider">Hatter</span> dies
</li><li>
   the evil team do not learn each other when the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> dies
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  But while those were all bad for team evil, consider:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Banshee</span> does not wake
</li><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span> does not create another <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span></li><li>

          <p>Only if the player's ability works differently to what their ability states.
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Mathematician</span> does not detect drunkenness or poisoning inherently,
  only actually bad info, a mechanical ability not working when it should have, and misregistration.
        </p>
          <p>
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Mathematician</span> is pinged when, for example:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Minion">Devil's Advocate</span> chooses the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>, becomes drunk, and the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> is executed the next day,
</li><li>
   the drunk <span class="Townsfolk">Fisherman</span> receives bad advice,
</li><li>
   the drunk or poisoned <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> fails to flip alignment when chosen by a player of the opposite alignment,
</li><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> is shown the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> misregistering as a good Townsfolk,
</li><li>
   the <span class="Minion">Poisoner</span> fails to poison the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> who instead makes the <span class="Minion">Poisoner</span> drunk,
</li><li>
   the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> misregistering as a Minion poisons the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span>,
</li><li>
   the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> misregisters as evil to the <span class="Townsfolk">Chef</span>,

   the poisoned <span class="Townsfolk">Soldier</span> dies to the Demon's attack,
</li><li>
   the poisoned, but not self-poisoned, <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span> chooses the Demon.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  If a player still gets true info despite drunkenness / poisoning / misregistration,

   the <span class="Townsfolk">Empath</span> sat between the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> misregistering as evil and the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> registering as a Townsfolk correctly received a one.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Mathematician</span> is not pinged if a drunk / poisoned mechanical ability is not used, or does nothing which is the expected result:

          <p>No, setup abilities have no effect if they come into play after setup.
  Generally, when a player gains an ability mid game, any "you start knowing x" or "X knows who you are" happen, but any [setup ability] does not.
