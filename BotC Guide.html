      </h4>
        <div class="answer">

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes, but not before N2 and assuming that they are alive and good.
  The <span class="Outsider">Acrobat</span>'s death could give a great clue to the <span class="Outsider">Puzzlemaster</span>.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Because:
<ul><li>
   it is not intended for the source of drunkenness / poisoning to be figured out by night order
</li><li>
   the evil team needs a chance to poison them.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  Some STs do run some of the other triggered abilities at their spot in the night order and they should clarify how they do it.
  But triggered abilities, except the <span class="Outsider">Acrobat</span>, can happen right after whatever triggered them,
  or only slightly delayed until the night time in cases such as:
<ul><li>
   the executed <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> or <span class="Outsider">Hatter</span></li><li>
   the <span class="Minion">Scarlet Woman</span>, who although would have immediately become the Demon, being formally confirmed as such

        <div class="answer">

          <p>No, since she is drunk / poisoned she cannot affect other players: there is no announcement and no waking of her targets.

          <p>

          <p>Yes, as the Al-Had's ability has malfunctioned due to another character's ability.

          <p>
  It does not, however, register for the <span class="Townsfolk">Fool</span> if they end up dying twice to the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> in the same night as the <span class="Townsfolk">Fool</span> ability has worked as intended.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Almost certainly. The game ends as soon as an end condition is met, which can occur before a character ability has fully resolved.
  With just two players left alive the game ends so the game can end in the middle of the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span>'s picks,
  which, as with the other multi-kill Demons, happen in order.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> chooses the three living players with herself last, she is guaranteed to win as long as she says "live":
  If any of the two players before her say die, they die immediately and the game is over with only two players left alive, evil wins.
  If all say "live" then they die in order, so the first player dies leaving just two players left alive, the game is over and evil wins.
        </p>
          <p>
  If, instead to be safe, the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> chooses the other two living players and a dead player,
  then if anyone says die the game is over,
  and if they all choose live, then they all die and, again, the game is over.
        </p>
          <p>
  The ST still needs to prompt the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> for her picks because she could still mess up,
  by choosing dead players that then resurrect:
  a dead pick will say live and at least one of other picks will say die so the game continues because there are now still more than two alive.
        </p>
          <p>
  It is of course also possible for the living player picked with two dead players to mess up,
  as should they pick die then the game instantly ends, no matter what the dead players pick.

          <p>Yes, in the order that they were picked.

  The players would die in the order the Al-Had chose them,
  with any on death abilities handled as they trigger,
  but the ST will end the game as soon as end game condition is met, 
  such as only two players left alive.
  So if the choices were the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span>, the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span>, and another role in that order,
  the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span> would die and someone would become the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span>,
  then the player who was the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> would die and the game would end. 
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> were first,
  the Al-Had would be offered the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> swap,

  If they instead swapped the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> with the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span>,
  then the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span> would not trigger and instead there would be another <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> swap.

          <p>The Storm Caught player can be picked by the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> but cannot die.
  This can be a way to force a good player who does not want to die to do so,

  This situation can arise if the ST decides, as is their right, to run the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> at their turn in the night order.
  Other STs prefer to run the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> at the first opportunity, so after the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> is executed,

        <h4 class="question">Who should the ST kill when the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> triggers?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>It is going to be very specific to the exact characters in play and alive.
  Some general guidelines and ideas:
<ul><li>
   In most cases, leave the Demon alive in the final three, otherwise the game ends in good's favour using a Minion ability.
</li><li>
   The Demon can be killed if there is an <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span> pair both still alive, leaving the choice for town to choose between the two twins with a non-Demon third player.
</li><li>
   The final three cannot be the Twins and the Demon as that is an automatic evil win.
</li><li>
   It is a bad idea to leave hard-confirmed characters alive in final three.
    A final three that includes the proc'd <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span> and the <span class="Townsfolk">Professor</span> who resurrected a dead player would be unfair on evil who managed to get their <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> executed.
</li><li>
   If the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span> killed by the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> chose a player between executions, the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span>-picked player can be left alive to cast suspicion on the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span> claim.
</li><li>
   There is no mechanical problem to leave only evil left alive in final three as the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> kill does not require a nomination,
    just the pointing, but this can be very hard on good to have to work out exactly which of the evil players is actually the Demon.
</li><li>
   There are some abilities that can prevent the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> coming down to a final three and instead having four or even five left alive. 
    While this can be interesting, it should be used sparingly, as it soft-confirms a few players
    (the player claiming <span class="Townsfolk">Sailor</span> or <span class="Townsfolk">Fool</span> is almost certainly good / the <span class="Townsfolk">Tea Lady</span> and their neighbours / ... ).

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Mechanically, nothing.
  Their vote is still counted, otherwise the total will be less than it should be, automatically hard confirming the <span class="Outsider">Butler</span>, which is unfair for the evil team.
  Also, mistakes happen, just play on for now.
        </p>
          <p>
  Later, the ST should speak with them privately and remind them of the constraints of their ability,
  and let them know that it is considered cheating to purposefully vote without their master.
  Generally this is enough to keep a player paying more attention,
  because most people are not playing this game in bad faith nor looking to cheat.
        </p>
          <p>
  It is also irrelevant if they knew, suspected or were totally unaware that they were drunk or poisoned when they voted.
  They should not attempt to vote without their master to test for drunkenness or poisoning,
  as their ability is a social contract that they must always abide by as they have no way of knowing if their ability is functioning or not.
        </p>
          <p>
  If they keep doing it though, then it should be dealt with however the group deals with cheating:
  ending the game early, letting it finish but talking about it after, not inviting that person back, etc.
  There is no prescriptive option for what to do with someone who is cheating, as that is a social issue for the group to handle.

          <p>The <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> is told that they are one of the Demons on the script.
  Some STs will confirm that they are still good, but RAW this is unnecessary.
  The ST takes the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span>'s picks and informs the Demon that the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> player is their <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> and who they chose.
  The Demon will deduce from this that the player they were shown has to be the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span>.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> asks what character they are at any point while they have the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> ability,
  they should be told that they are the Demon that they were shown.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> loses the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> ability through a further execution,
  then they are treated exactly as they would have been had that execution occurred without a <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> execution beforehand.
  They are not told about no longer being a Demon but if they ask what character they are, they should be told that they are the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span>, 
  with nothing confirmed about why they were told that they were a Demon.
        </p>
          <p>
  All of this assumes that the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> is neither drunk or poisoned.
  If they ate an evil player then they can be lied to about their ability.
  If a player with suspicion on them is executed then it is fun to deceive the drunk <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> with the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> ability.
  And on a script with the <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span> or the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> and the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span>, it is possible for the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> to believe that they really are the Demon.

  The <span class="Outsider">Mutant</span> made <span class="Minion">Cerenovus</span> mad as the <span class="Outsider">Mutant</span> is dependent on the mercy of the ST.

  This could be as simple as saying "I am &lt;character&gt;", but it is up to the ST to judge if the player is making a genuine attempt.
  For sure the <span class="Outsider">Mutant</span> is an unusual case as the acutal <span class="Outsider">Mutant</span> usually does not admit to being what they are,

  Technically they will remain mad until the Cere's night order, but there is no longer a downside in breaking it.

          <p>Executions can occur at night and it is a legal way to punish good sometimes.

  Madness is about publicly convincing other players that something is true but does not mean that they cannot still use their ability in private.
  The ST is not the group so does not need to be convinced privately by a mad player.
  Anyone can talk to the ST at any time for any reason, so approaching them privately is never a madness break.
  If challenged as to why they approached the ST the player could reply 'I had a question for the ST'.
        </p>
          <p>
  However, if the player announced to the group they were going to get their information for their actual character, that would be a different story and handled accordingly.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Maybe.
        </p>
          <p>
  Usually when a Minion learns that they are now the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>, they are waking due to the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>'s ability rather than their own.
  In which case they are very definitely not waking to their own ability so do not register to the <span class="Townsfolk">Chambermaid</span>.
        </p>
          <p>
  However, the SW's ability is about becoming the Demon should the previous one die for any reason,
  so arguably it is their own ability causing them to wake to learn that they are now the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>,
  thus registering to the <span class="Townsfolk">Chambermaid</span>.
        </p>
          <p>
  A reasonable way to run this interaction is to therefore ask why the SW is becoming the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>:
<ul><li>
   if the SW is the only option (single Minion game / other Minions are dead) then the ST could rule that it is the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>'s ability turning the SW;
</li><li>
   if the SW is not the only option but is prioritised ahead of another Minion who would have been turned then they have turned due to their own SW ability;
</li><li>
   if the SW is not the only option but happens to be picked ahead of any other Minion then it is reasonable to treat that as the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>'s ability turning them.

          <p>
  The <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> must be alive in order to trigger their loss condition;

          <p>Yes, unless the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> is drunk due to the <span class="Outsider">Puzzlemaster</span>'s setup ability.
        </p>
          <p><span class="Outsider">Puzzlemaster</span> drunkenness would prevent the Minions learning the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span>, as the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> is drunk during N1 setup.

  With that understood, using the <span class="Outsider">Puzzlemaster</span> to make the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> drunk is not recommended,

  Most STs assign the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> once tokens have been handed out and know the Grimoire, allowing them to balance the game much better.
  The entry for the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> states "while preparing the first night", which would be once tokens are already handed out.
  But it is also fine for the ST to decide beforehand to make the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> a specific character regardless of token distribution.

          <p>At the start of the game no, unless it is a <span class="Fabled">Bootlegger</span> game or a it is a character which can start with multiples in play (<span class="Townsfolk">Village Idiot</span>).
        </p>
          <p>
  The <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> must believe that they are a Townsfolk and the Mario any good character.
  At setup this is achieved by substituting their token with another Townsfolk/Outsider token.
  It is due to the physical limitations of the game that the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> and the Mario tend to see an out of play character; most characters only come with one token.
  <span class="Townsfolk">Village Idiot</span> is an exception: it is allowed for the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span>/<span class="Minion">Marionette</span> to believe that they are a VI even when there are real VIs in game.

          <p>The ET is deceived as to their ability working, so they can be told an arbitrary player and a character.
  The actual Good Twin learns nothing, since their being informed is part of the ET's ability.

  In SnV where the droisoned ET is rare, and impossible N1, STs will often wake the Twins together, and have them make eye contact.

  The Demon would not know why this is, as it is indistinguishable from the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> just being drunk or poisoned that night.
  The ST can show any player as the fake <span class="Townsfolk">Exorcist</span> to the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>.
        </p>
          <p>
  The ST must be cautious: if the <span class="Townsfolk">Exorcist</span> is in play they might publicly claim who they picked, 
  and if this differs to what the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> was told,
  then this could be detrimental to the evil team.

  The ST cannot keep track of everyone's votes,

  The FT just checks if any of the two players they pick is a Demon, or registering as one, and a dead Demon is still a Demon.

  Death does not change a player's character type, it just makes them dead,

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes, if the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> misregisters as a Minion or Demon,

          <p>No. The BH being shown the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> is not choosing the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> with their ability, so they cannot be made drunk or flip the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>.

          <p>No.
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span> is targeting a player by way of choosing a character - only the player with that character token could possibly become <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span> drunk.
  This can be treated as though the ability is pointing at the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>, even though the player is not.
  However, the <span class="Minion">Cerenovus</span> is not choosing the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> in the same sense; they are not interacting with the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> player just by pointing at <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> on the character list.

        <h4 class="question">How does the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span> interact with the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>If the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span> points to the unpicked <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> (or a player with the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> ability)
  then, no matter what character they are gambled as, 
  the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span> becomes drunk
  and the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> turns or remains the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span>'s alignment.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span> gambles another player as the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>, the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> has no effect on the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span>.

          <p>
  So the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span> pointing to the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> on the script is treated differently to the <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span> doing same.
  The rationale for this is that the <span class="Townsfolk">Gambler</span>'s guessing a player as a character is not targeting the player with that character,
  whereas the <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span> is effectively picking a player via their character
  so choosing a <span class="Outsider">Goon</span>, if in play and yet to be picked, would trigger the drunkenness.

  So if in a non <span class="Traveller">Butcher</span> game the first nomination of the day happens to be on the <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span> resulting in an execution,

  The game ended at the point when the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> was executed and the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> did not have the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> ability.
  This results in a final two where the Demon is alive, so an evil win,

  There was no period of time between the execution and the game ending for the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> to gain the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span> ability,

  For example, in a final three of the <span class="Outsider">Heretic</span>, the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> and the <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span> the day ends without execution results in an evil win:
  No execution with three alive with both <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> and <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span> in play means a good character win condition competing with an evil character win condition, so good wins.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>During Demon info the <span class="Demon">Kazali</span> is not told who their Minions are, even though they just picked them.
  They do learn their bluffs and any other relevant info to the Demon (<span class="Minion">Marionette</span>, <span class="Townsfolk">King</span>, <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>).
        </p>
          <p>
  The Minions are told their new character and any other relevant information (<span class="Outsider">Damsel</span>) but do not learn the <span class="Demon">Kazali</span>.
  When running in person games, the ST should put the <span class="Demon">Kazali</span> to sleep and wake each Minion separately.
        </p>
          <p>
  Most of the time it is not that important as the <span class="Demon">Kazali</span> can just gather the evil team together and get them up to speed,
  though it is more relevant if the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> or the <span class="Townsfolk">Soldier</span> are on the script which can disrupt the <span class="Demon">Kazali</span>'s picks.

          <p>No.  [Setup effects] always happen before any other start of game effects such as the <span class="Outsider">Puzzlemaster</span>'s,

        </p>
          <p>
  This means that, for example:

          <p>It works as a wild card so that no matter what Minions the <span class="Demon">Kazali</span> creates,

  the result will always be a valid setup.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Demon">Kazali</span> chose an Outsider, then their setup was [-1 Outsider]. 
  If an extra Outsider was added to the base count but then the <span class="Demon">Kazali</span> chose none, their setup was [+1 Outsider].
        </p>

          <p>The ST chooses one Demon player to show them.

          <p>The <span class="Townsfolk">Sage</span> learns "two players, one of which is the Demon who killed them".
  So the ST can show any <span class="Demon">Legion</span> player as the one that killed the <span class="Townsfolk">Sage</span>

          <p>No.
  <span class="Demon">Legion</span>, like the <span class="Demon">Lil' Monsta</span>, does not wake to kill, with kills directed by the ST.
  So while exorcism may not stop Demon kills,
  the <span class="Townsfolk">Sage</span> would still need to see a <span class="Demon">Legion</span> player that is capable of killing,
  meaning that an exorcised <span class="Demon">Legion</span> cannot legally be seen by the <span class="Townsfolk">Sage</span> as their correct ping.

          <p>Yes, but this would be in addition to registering as a Demon, not instead of, so the <span class="Demon">Legion</span> player will stay die.

          <p><span class="Demon">Legion</span> registers as both <span class="Demon">Legion</span> and an arbitrary Minion at all times,

  In the case of the <span class="Townsfolk">Slayer</span>,
  it has no effect since the <span class="Townsfolk">Slayer</span> ability does not have any exclusive interactions with Minions;

          <p>Yes, though <span class="Demon">Legion</span> should usually never kill more than two, and if they do multi-kill it should be multiple Legions.

          <p>
  For three nights:
<ul><li>
   the Minions do not wake to choose who holds LM; the ST does not wake the Minions to deceive them that they are working normally as no player is LM.
</li><li>
   nobody dies due to LM.
</li><li>
   LM cannot move; whoever was holding LM before the <span class="Townsfolk">Courtier</span> picked will keeping holding LM.
</li><li>
   although LM is drunk, the player holding LM is not drunk so can still use their ability.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  Good wins as normal if the babysitter dies.  
        </p>
          <p>
  Second interpretation:
        </p>
          <p>
  Since it is not actually possible for a character to be drunk, only players, the current babysitter is drunk for three days and nights.
  But it has no effect on <span class="Demon">Lil' Monsta</span> itself.

          <p>Yes.
  The <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> ability reads "and who you choose at night", so the Demon learns who they picked. 
  But the Demon does not learn why they picked,
  so if the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> and the <span class="Demon">Lleech</span> are on the script, then the Demon would not know which token the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> saw, which might cause issues on N2 when deciding who to kill.

          <p>No, they only have to be told their new role.

          <p>
  RAW players only learn when their alignment changes.
  The ex <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> does not learn their alignment because their alignment has not changed;
  they were good before the character change and are still good.
  They may still believe that they are evil or they maybe utterly confused, especially if they were turned into the Demon that they already believed themself to be!
        </p>
          <p>
  If a player were to enquire about their alignment, in this scenario or otherwise, they should be told something like "your alignment has not changed".
  An exception can be made for an inexperienced player, where it might be helpful for the ST to tell them their alignment.
  With this understood, some STs still choose to always tell a player their alignment when they are turned from/to a Demon/Minion.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes, but this is discouraged since it can lead to the ST controlling the kills:
<ul><li>
   the ST chooses a kill for the fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> and informs the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>, 
</li><li>
   the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> attacks the fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s target to keep up the lie,
</li><li>
   the Demon attacks the same target to keep up the lie.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  The ST can do this if their group is cool with the idea
  or perhaps to ensure seeing the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> token does not confirm someone as the Demon.
        </p>
          <p>
  It is possible to simulate the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> to the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> without dictating the kills by having the actual Demon be the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span>,
  and the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> believe that they are a Demon that does not make a N1 choice, such as the <span class="Demon">Po</span>.
  The ST places both Demon tokens in the bag, remembering that the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> is the real Demon, and showing each to the other as their <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>.
  Since the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> kills out of sync, who they poison each night can be shown to the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> as the fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> pick for the following night.
  Then when the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> picks the same player to kill, the timing of the pick's death to the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> will sync with the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s expectations.
  The Demon never knows what Demon their <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> believes themself to be,
  so the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> will not be aware that their fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> is the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span>.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes.
        </p>
          <p>
  The ST is already lying to the player that they are the Demon,
  so they can lie about them being affected by the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span>, even when they are not in the game.
        </p>
          <p>
  Anything on the script that could happen or be told to the Demon can be simulated for the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>:
<ul><li>
   fake <span class="Townsfolk">Magician</span>, by showing an extra "Minion"
</li><li>
   fake <span class="Townsfolk">King</span>,
</li><li>
   fake <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>,
</li><li>
   fake <span class="Townsfolk">Exorcist</span>, ...
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  While the ST can give the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> fake info, should is another matter entirely.
  The ST is also free to give the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> correct info when these characters are really in play,
  which could keep the deception up for longer as it lines up with what these characters are publicly claiming,
  ultimately benefiting the evil team.

  The TPI consider 'yes, they can' and 'no, they cannot' to both be valid rulings, so the ST should pick their preference and inform their players which they run:
<ol><li>
   The <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> cannot think they are the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> as the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> thinks they are evil,
    which contradicts the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> thinking they are good,
    so the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> cannot be the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>.
</li><li>
   The <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> can think they are a good character that themself thinks is the Demon. 
</li></ol></p>
          <p>
  If the preference is 'no they cannot' and the Demon lands between the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> and a Minion then, if there is no <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> in the game, that would need a rerack.
  To prevent this from happening an alternative setup should be used,
  such as placing an extra Townsfolk token in the bag instead of the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>,
  then after the tokens are distributed,
  deciding which of the Townsfolk players to make the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>,
  informing that they are a Demon from the script

          <p>Yes, however the Demon would still learn the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> as their Minion,

          <p>The <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> is drunk but from their point of view there is no difference:

          <p>
  The Demon:
<ul><li>
   learns the Philo as their <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>,

   learns the Philo's picks for as long as the Philo is alive, sober and healthy,

          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span> <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> ever becomes poisoned or drunk then the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> will sober and the Demon will see the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s picks, not the Philo <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s.

          <p>They become self-drunk and their ability is used up.
        </p>
          <p>
  Gaining the ability of the Philo turns them into the Philo-Philo creating a paradox

        </p>
          <p>
  The ST could check in on the player in the morning and make sure they wanted to do that instead of trying to save their ability

      </h4>

          <p>
  The ability is not gained and the <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span>'s once per game ability is now spent, but the trade-off is they have learnt an in play role.
  For example, attempting to gain the <span class="Townsfolk">Engineer</span> role when <span class="Demon">Legion</span> is in play will alert the <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span> to it being a <span class="Demon">Legion</span> game.

        </p>
          <p>
  However, if they chose an info ability then for as long as they remain drunk or poisoned,
  the ST should deceive them that they gained the ability by giving them arbitrary information when they would expect it.
  The ST is free to stop the deception if they want to,

          <p>The <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> has to think that she is a good character, so if a Townsfolk or Outsider is changed into the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>,

          <p>
  The <span class="Demon">Pukka</span>'s kills always die poisoned.
  This is what allows the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> to kill characters such as the <span class="Townsfolk">Fool</span>, <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span> or <span class="Townsfolk">Sailor</span>, who might otherwise survive thanks to their own ability.
        </p>
          <p>
  But dying poisoned also means that effects which trigger upon death are disabled meaning for example that:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> is not offered the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> swap when the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> dies
</li><li>
   a good player does not become drunk when the <span class="Outsider">Sweetheart</span> dies
</li><li>
   the ST does not get an out of play Minion ability when the <span class="Outsider">Plague Doctor</span> dies
</li><li>
   the evil players do not get to switch their roles when the <span class="Outsider">Hatter</span> dies
</li><li>
   the evil team do not learn each other when the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> dies
</li><li>
   whoever the <span class="Outsider">Moonchild</span> or the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span> pick is irrelevant
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  But while those were all bad for team evil, consider:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span> does not create another <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span></li><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Sage</span> can be told two non-Demon players
</li><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Ravenkeeper</span> may be given false info
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  Players becoming healthy straight after they die matters for the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span> and the <span class="Outsider">Moonchild</span>;
  when they pick a player after they learn that they died in the night, their abilities are active.
  However, if they are executed or die in anyway during day while <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> poisoned, their abilities malfunction.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>This depends on who the Lycan and the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> pick each night.
  Note that the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> still poisons a player every night after the Lycan pick.
        </p>
          <p>
  On any night when the Lycan successfully kills a good player,
  and they are not made subsequently drunk or poisoned,
  the Lycan protection is in effect:
  after the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> picks another player to poison, the previously poisoned player cannot die, and they become healthy.
        </p>
          <p>
  On a night that the Lycan kills a good player and the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> then happens to pick the Lycan to poison,
  the Lycan's protection is immediately removed,
  so the previously picked player dies, and they become healthy.
  The Lycan is now scheduled to die tomorrow.
        </p>
          <p>
  Any night when the <span class="Townsfolk">Lycanthrope</span> does not successfully kill,

  there is no Lycan protection so the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> functions normally:

  Their ability reads "one player is drunk, even if you die", rather than "even if you are dead",

          <p>They could, but probably should not.
        </p>
          <p>
  The SW's ability explicitly says "you become the Demon."
  They would become whatever Demon the ST registers the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> as, but never a <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span>.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes.
  "Each night, choose an alive player: a chosen Demon swaps characters and alignments with you and is then poisoned."
  So if the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> registers as the Demon the swap happens,
  with the <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span> becoming the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> or whatever Demon is on the script that the ST thinks the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> is registering as,
  and the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> becoming a self-poisoned <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span>.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes, but don't.
        </p>
          <p>
  This makes the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> into the good <span class="Demon">Imp</span>, meaning that they need only to get themself killed in order to win.
  If there are no living Minions to become the <span class="Demon">Imp</span> then this could possibly keep the game going,
  but still it is not recommended for the <span class="Demon">Imp</span> to do this.
  The ST should only do this if all the actual Minions are dead.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>No.
        </p>
          <p>
  The <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> only registers as the <span class="Minion">Spy</span>, but does not gain the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> ability, therefore cannot register as a Townsfolk.
        </p>
          <p>
  Think of registering as: if an ability "asks" a player about their character or alignment or living status, they can "answer" with something other than what they are.
  Misregistering can never change the game directly (like executing someone).
  It can however trick someone else's ability into doing it for them,
  like the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> who nominates the <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span> - the <span class="Minion">Spy</span>'s ability cannot kill themself, but it can trick the <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span>'s ability into thinking they are a Townsfolk,
  after which the <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span>'s real ability can execute them.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>No, registering as a character does not give the player that character's ability, so they do not actually have the <span class="Minion">Scarlet Woman</span>'s ability.
  However:

          <p>
  The ST is not allowed to lie to the player about their character or alignment unless the ability allows for that.
  The <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> does not believe they are anything else; they always know that they are the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span>.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>There is no +1 Minion, because the Demon is already <span class="Demon">Riot</span>, so there is the usual number of evil players who are all <span class="Demon">Riot</span>.
        </p>
          <p>
  The <span class="Demon">Lil' Monsta</span> adds +1 Minion because the Monsta token does not actually go into the bag; the extra Minion is dealt so that there are the correct number of evil players.
  In the case of <span class="Demon">Riot</span>, the correct number of evil tokens go into the bag because the ST adds that many <span class="Demon">Riot</span> tokens, so there is no need to add an extra Minion.
        </p>
          <p>
  Just to clarify:
<ul><li>
   there are not supposed to be Minions in <span class="Demon">Riot</span> games; the problem for good is that every starting evil player is a Demon, so they need to get rid of every evil player to win.
</li><li>
   no player is the <span class="Demon">Lil' Monsta</span>; the Minions choose a babysitter for the <span class="Demon">Lil' Monsta</span> each night, making that player count as the Demon for all game mechanics that care.

          <p>No, the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span> is not told anything about regurgitations.
  The ST makes the decision on regurgitation before the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span> wakes,

          <p>If the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span> chose two people the night before, then just before they attack tonight, one of those people they chose, if they are currently dead, may come back to life.
  Note that if the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span> is chosen by the <span class="Townsfolk">Exorcist</span> and does not wake to attack anyone tonight, they can still bring one of their previous night's targets back to life 
  because regurgitation is not tied to their waking up. 
        </p>
          <p>
  Note that the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span>'s previous targets do not need to have been killed by the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span>'s attack in order to be revived,
  they only need to be dead on the next night.
  This means that the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span> can choose someone who is already dead and revive them the next night,
  or the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span>'s target can survive the attack,
  then die the next day and subsequently be revived because they are now dead in time.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Regurgitation, if it happens, happens before the kills.
  So the night would start with four alive,
  regurgitation would bring this up to five,

  the ST decides who acts first, which is important for this situation.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span>-SC acts first and becomes the Demon, 
  then the old Demon becomes a self-poisoned <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span> and the actual SC becomes sober
  (since the Philo causing them to be drunk is no longer in play; we have a new instance of the Philo).
  Now the <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span> can also choose the new Demon (the game's starting Philo) and swap to the Demon.
        </p>
          <p>
  So it is possible for the starting <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span> to become the evil Demon and then the good self-poisoned Snaker Charmer.

  The two parts of their misregistration ability, register as good and register as a Townsfolk/Outsider, work in tandem.

  The drunkenness due to the VI ability is a setup effect.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The <span class="Townsfolk">Alchemist</span> <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span> incorrectly learns their Minion ability, which has to be an in play Minion ability.
  Then they learn as their twin the incorrect character for a good player.
  So they have learnt:
<ul><li>
   an in play Minion,
</li><li>
   a confirmed good player,
</li><li>
   the Demon is a <span class="Demon">Vortox</span>.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  Note that only the information is affected in a <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> game, not the mechanics,
  so:
<ul><li>
   an oppositely aligned twin is still correctly assigned,
  which in this situation is an evil aligned Good Twin,
  who wakes to learn any player except the <span class="Townsfolk">Alchemist</span> as the <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span>.
</li><li>
   evil wins if the <span class="Townsfolk">Alchemist</span> is executed,
  while good cannot win if both of the Twins are alive.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>ST choice; it could go either way.
        </p>
          <p>
  Two actions that occur at dusk would attempt to happen at the same time:
<ul><li>
   At dusk tomorrow, all players made drunk by the <span class="Townsfolk">Minstrel</span> become sober; the ST removes the EVERYONE IS DRUNK reminder.  
</li><li>
   Each dusk, if no player was executed today, the game ends and the evil team wins.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  This is an order of operations issue.  Whichever happens first loses the interaction.
        </p>
          <p>
  One interpretation:
  The <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> will be drunk until dusk. 
  The day ends with no execution, then dusk happens, so the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> is still drunk at the point they otherwise would have won.
  They do not become sober until that start of the night phase.
  The game continues.
        </p>
          <p>
  Alternative interpretation:
  First the <span class="Townsfolk">Minstrel</span>'s tokens are removed, then the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> wincon is checked - evil wins.
        </p>
          <p>
  Given that the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> was drunk up until literally that moment, arguably it makes more intuitive sense that they would fail to win the game.

          <p>
  More specifically team red must learn non-Minions as Minions and non-Demons as Demons,

   exorcised Demons still learn they have been exorcised (they just learn the wrong player),

   the <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span>-<span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> would still inform the Minions that the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> is in play.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes.
  It was previously thought not, but since the ruling that the <span class="Townsfolk">Fortune Teller</span>'s Red Herring yields a 'no' in a <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> game,
  the consensus is that this implies that the <span class="Demon">Vortox</span> can flip information after accounting for any form of misregistration.

          <p>
  For example:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Empath</span> who should learn a zero when they neighbour a good player and the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> registering as good,

</li><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Chef</span> seeing the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> as evil can see a pair when there are in fact no pairs in the game, so can learn a zero, again true info.
</li><li>
   the VI who checks the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> registering as good or the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> registering as evil can learn their true alignments.

          <p>There is no immediate visible effect.  The game continues because importantly the <span class="Demon">Zombuul</span> has never actually died.

  so the Town Square, which is the players' responsibility, is not updated by removing their death shroud.
        </p>
          <p>

<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Empath</span> and <span class="Townsfolk">Tea Lady</span> abilities would no longer skip over them;
</li><li>

  It would therefore be valid for the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span>'s jump to be processed as per usual,

  In full, the ST's options are:

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Either. The way <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span> arbitrary deaths works is that the ST can block any kills (or not), and can cause new kills originating from the <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span>.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The ST can allow the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> to jump.
        </p>
          <p>
  ..ST's options are as follows, assuming the new <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> chooses an Outsider when deaths are arbitrary:
        </p>
          <p>
  If the new <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> targets an Outsider then, since deaths are arbitrary, the choices are:
<ol><li>
   the chosen Outsider is PH protected and does not die;
</li><li>
   the chosen Outsider is PH protected and does not die, but then is PH killed, so no jump;
</li><li>
   the chosen Outsider dies to the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span>, so the jump happens.
</li></ol></p>
          <p>
  "Deaths are arbitrary" means the ST can allows deaths go go through, or not go through.
  So if the ST allows the Demon's choice to go through, that one is an attack from the Demon, not the PH,
  and if the ST blocks it, then it is treated similarly to the player being protected from the Demon that night.
  Any "additional" deaths are considered attacks from the PH.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Poisoning and drunkenness mechanically work the same. 
  If an ability makes a player drunk or it makes a player poisoned, it has the same effect. 
  So, information is arbitrary and mechanical based abilities do not work at all.

          <p>
  Being drunk and being poisoned are technically different for the purposes of <span class="Townsfolk">Savant</span> statements and <span class="Townsfolk">Artist</span> questions,

  The <span class="Minion">Poisoner</span> acts early in the night order, before the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>, so still targets a player.

          <p>If droison would be applied while the character is themself droisoned, it is not.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>This will likely depend on the source of the protection and the order of the Demon's picks. 
        </p>
          <p>
  If that player is protected due to their own ability (sober <span class="Townsfolk">Sailor</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Soldier</span>) then they cannot die no matter who else dies that night.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the protection is due to another player (<span class="Townsfolk">Innkeeper</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Monk</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Tea Lady</span>) then that player cannot die, as long as source of the protection remains alive.
  This means who and the order of the Demon's picks is important:
<ul><li>
   If the source was not selected by the Demon, the protected player cannot die.
</li><li>
   If the source was selected after the protected player, the protected player survives but then the source, barring any other forms of protection, will die.
</li><li>
   If the source was selected before, then on their death (which includes choosing to die to the Al-Had), the protection is removed,
    and the target of their protection is no longer safe.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  In the case of the Al-Had,
  all picks are publicly announced and the players still have to make a choice
  and if all three players choose live,
  or all three are alive at the end of their choices,
  then all three die in the order that they were selected.
  Again, the order of death matters: the protected player survives if the source of the protection was picked afterwards (or not at all).

  The order of the kills is important: as long as the player causing the drunkenness dies before the drunk player, then the drunk player becomes sober.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The Demon should be shown three characters that are safe for her to bluff as, to avoid double claiming a good player.
  These characters should:
<ul><li>
   be any combination of Townsfolk and Outsiders; two Townsfolk and one Outsider is pretty common,

  It is strongly recommended that whatever characters the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> or the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> believe themself to be are not given as bluffs;
  although out of play, the Demon might not appreciate receiving these!
  Additionally, some STs would consider it illegal to do so; the argument is that the Demon should see three out of play <em>tokens</em>.
  But if the group is experienced it could be attempted, perhaps to signal to the Demon who the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> is.

   the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>, along with any picks that they make each night.

          <p>
  The <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>, the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> and the <span class="Townsfolk">King</span> are all "the Demon knows who you are" abilities,

        </p>
          <p>
  The new Demon does not learn any bluffs or the Minions, as this info was given in the Demon info step which already happened,
  unless it was skipped because of an in play <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span>,
  in which case all Minions and Demons learn each other when the last sober and healthy PG ability dies.

  The Philo only ever gains the ability, she does not turn into the character, so the character remains out of play.
        </p>

  Any character out of play on setup can be given as a bluff,

          <p>

          <p>
  While players dying can lower the number of votes required:
<ul><li>
   any nomination still needs to have more votes than any other in order to put someone on the block,

   there is no impact on nominations that have already happened - whether someone is on the block or not is determined immediately in that moment,

          <p>
  For example, if player X gets five votes and that is not enough and then players die or travel away meaning five would be enough now, player X is still safe,

  Nothing really stops that,

  It would probably be best to conclude the vote before resolving player killing abilities.

  Another player suspects A is mad and asks her to prove if she is mad or not by saying something that could get her executed for breaking madness.
  Would saying something like "I am mad that player B is evil" count as breaking madness, despite her keeping madness the rest of the time?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The ST should not consider this a madness break.
        </p>
          <p>
  Player A is doing that in an attempt to convince the town that they are not mad, and the intent and sincerity of their madness is still retained.
  Intent matters a lot more for madness than the words someone says.
        </p>
          <p>
  The group might want to address this issue together as asking someone who is mad to break it to prove that they are mad runs against the spirit of madness.

  All madness related abilities, except for <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span>, are phrased with "might" to stop the evil team from exploiting

  With the <span class="Outsider">Mutant</span> the "might" is used to ensure that it functions as an Outsider by making the execution happen at an inconvenient time for good.

  "Madness" is a Clocktower term that means "trying to convince people of something".
  Some characters like the <span class="Townsfolk">Pixie</span> interact with madness,

  Anybody who is trying to convince players of anything in the game is being mad,

  So if Town went to sleep with a player alive,
  and that player is alive in the morning,
  Town does not learn anything. 
        </p>
          <p>
  However,
  if the player has a start knowing ability or a trigger on death ability, then it would activate again, so they would probably figure out what happened.

        <h4 class="question">Does a player who is resurrected / regurgitated then immediately killed again learn this?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>No, most of the time.
        </p>
          <p>
  The player is not informed, nor is there an announcement in the morning, since the ST only announces visible changes to a player's life/death status.
  So any player who is revived and killed in the same night is unlikely to learn this.
  Any "you start knowing" characters will be dead before they get to use their ability again,
  while any "when you learn that you are dead" abilties do not apply, since the players have not relearnt this.
        </p>
          <p>
  However, abilities that trigger on death might be triggered, so:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Ravenkeeper</span> getting another use of their ability may surmise that they were revived and killed in the same night;
</li><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Sage</span> getting two new players would likely figure out that they were revived and then killed by a Demon in the same night.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>ST choice. 
        </p>
          <p>
  For example a resurrected <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> is treated as a new <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> and can get a new grandchild.
  If a new one is assigned, only the new grandchild being killed by the Demon triggers her death.
  Additionally, the new grandchild could be dead, protecting the <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> from being able to trigger their own death.
        </p>
          <p>
  For other first night info characters, if the info has not changed, they should technically be wakened and given the same info.
  It matters for several reasons, including droison, dying later, or being checked by the <span class="Townsfolk">Chambermaid</span>.

          <p>They get their new "starting" info after the poisoning and killing roles get to act.

          <p>
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Professor</span> already acts after the poisoning and killing roles act,
  so if the <span class="Townsfolk">Professor</span> revives a night 1 role, they get their info immediately. 
        </p>
          <p>
  A dead N1 role may be revived by the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> but then die again because all three chosen players picked live. 
        </p>
          <p>
  An <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> or <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span> revived N1 role may also be sniped by the <span class="Minion">Assassin</span> or other killing role before getting their new info.

        <h4 class="question">Since good wins on tie, why does executing the Good Twin while the <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span> is alive and the Demon dead result in an evil win?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Ability trumps over general game rules.
  So if two abilities cause a game tie, then the good one will win.
  If there is an ability game end condition and a regular game end condition, the ability wins out,
  such as the <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span> ability trumping the no Demons alive win condition.
  If two regular game end conditions are met at once, it is a tie and good wins.
  There are some exceptions for if it is impossible for one team to win, but the <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span> in SnV is not one of them.

  is only one more Outsider added?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes.
  In general, there can only be a maximum of the number of Outsiders that are on the script, because players cannot have duplicate tokens.
  So even if there is Outsider modification that equals up to having six total Outsiders in play, if the script only has four Outsiders on it, only four would be in play.
  This does not come up in most scripts though;
  the <span class="Minion">Baron</span> in a six player Teensyville with only two Outsiders on the script is probably where the limit being hit is most often seen.
