          <p>Because:

          <p>
  Some STs do run some of the other triggered abilities at their spot in the night order and they should clarify how they do it.
  But triggered abilities, except the <span class="Outsider">Acrobat</span>, can happen right after whatever triggered them,
  or only slightly delayed until the night time in cases such as:
<ul><li>
   the executed <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> or <span class="Outsider">Hatter</span></li><li>
   the <span class="Minion">Scarlet Woman</span>, who although would have immediately become the Demon, being formally confirmed as such

        </p>
          <p>
  On N1 the ST assigns the <span class="Townsfolk">Alchemist</span> an out of play Minion ability.
  But if they are N1 drunk or poisoned then instead of learning their correct ability
  they are told that they have another ability,
  typically one that is in play,
  and the ST will treat them as having that ability.
  When the <span class="Townsfolk">Alchemist</span> becomes sober and healthy, they do not change abilities, their actual ability that they had from setup now functions correctly,
  and the ST treats them as having that ability.
  Note that the <span class="Townsfolk">Alchemist</span> is only ever informed of a change of ability when they actually change ability, which is not the case here, so the ST tells them nothing.

  In both cases they are effectively the poisoned/drunk <span class="Townsfolk">Alchemist</span> and are told the wrong ability that has no effect,

          <p>Almost certainly. The game ends as soon as an end condition is met, which can occur before a character ability has fully resolved.
  With just two players left alive the game ends so the game can end in the middle of the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span>'s picks,

  If any of the two players before her say die, they die immediately and the game is over with only two players left alive, evil wins.
  If all say "live" then they die in order, so the first player dies leaving just two players left alive, the game is over and evil wins.

  If, instead to be safe, the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> chooses the other two living players and a dead player,

          <p>
  The ST still needs to prompt the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> for her picks because she could still mess up,

  As an extreme example:

   only the <span class="Townsfolk">Mayor</span> says die and their kill bounces to C, who dies,

          <p>Yes.

          <p>
  The only real restriction in an <span class="Townsfolk">Atheist</span> games is no evil players at setup.
  Arguably it is against the spirit of the <span class="Townsfolk">Atheist</span> to introduce Minions and Demons after setup,
  regardless of if they are good or not.
  But ultimately what is acceptable in an <span class="Townsfolk">Atheist</span> game is up to the ST and their group.

          <p>ST choice.

          <p>
  RAW the ST is not a player so is never a valid target for abilities, 
  but in an <span class="Townsfolk">Atheist</span> game the ST is free to break any rule so can allow it.
  However, as the <span class="Townsfolk">Atheist</span> only requires the ST's execution not their death, preventing them from dying would not accomplish anything.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>No, in an <span class="Townsfolk">Atheist</span> game the ST can break all rules and turn people evil.
  However, this is usually not fun for the players and not advised; keep all players good and give fake information that they need to "solve" as intended.

          <p><span class="Townsfolk">Atheist</span> "can" questions are almost certainly answerable with a "yes." Whether the ST should or not is debatable.

          <p>Yes.

        <h4 class="question">Who should the ST kill when the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> triggers?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>It is going to be very specific to the exact characters in play and alive.
  Some general guidelines and ideas:
<ul><li>
   In most cases, leave the Demon alive in the final three, otherwise the game ends in good’s favour using a Minion ability.
</li><li>
   The Demon can be killed if there is an <span class="Minion">Evil Twin</span> pair both still alive, leaving the choice for town to choose between the two twins with a non-Demon third player.
</li><li>
   The final three cannot be the twins and the Demon as that is an automatic evil win.
</li><li>
   It is a bad idea to leave hard-confirmed characters alive in final three.
    A final three that includes the proc'd <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span> and the <span class="Townsfolk">Professor</span> who resurrected a dead player would be unfair on evil who managed to get their <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> executed.
</li><li>
   If the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span> killed by the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> chose a player between executions, the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span>-picked player can be left alive to cast suspicion on the <span class="Outsider">Klutz</span> claim.
</li><li>
   There is no mechanical problem to leave only evil left alive in final three as the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> kill does not require a nomination,
    just the pointing, but this can be very hard on good to have to work out exactly which of the evil players is actually the Demon.
</li><li>
   There are some abilities that can prevent the <span class="Minion">Boomdandy</span> coming down to a final three and instead having four or even five left alive. 
    While this can be interesting, it should be used sparingly, as it soft-confirms a few players
    (the player claiming <span class="Townsfolk">Sailor</span> or <span class="Townsfolk">Fool</span> is almost certainly good / the <span class="Townsfolk">Tea Lady</span> and their neighbours / ... ).

          <p>Yes, it is possible for them to learn any dead evil player.
  The only restriction is that they cannot learn the same player twice in a row.
  The ST will need to consider if this is a fair move,
  since the BH only gets a new name when their current target dies, and the dead cannot die (unless they are first resurrected somehow),

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Mechanically, nothing.
  Their vote is still counted, otherwise the total will be less than it should be, automatically hard confirming the <span class="Outsider">Butler</span>, which is unfair for the evil team.
  Also, mistakes happen, just play on for now.
        </p>
          <p>
  Later, the ST should speak with them privately and remind them of the constraints of their ability,
  and let them know that it is considered cheating to purposefully vote without their master.
  Generally this is enough to keep a player paying more attention,
  because most people are not playing this game in bad faith nor looking to cheat.
        </p>
          <p>
  If they keep doing it though, then deal with it however the group would like to deal with cheating.
  Ending the game early, letting it finish but talking about it after, not inviting that person back, etc.
  There is no prescriptive option for what to do with someone who is cheating, as that is a social issue for the group to handle.

          <p>No. If the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> privately asks to use an info ability that they do not have,

          <p>
  Publicly claimed abilties like the <span class="Townsfolk">Slayer</span>, should be entertained in the way that the ST does for anyone else,

          <p>
  Instead, the ST does what they would do for the standard character with that ability.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>The <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> is told that they are one of the Demons on the script.
  Some STs will confirm that they are still good, but RAW this is unnecessary.
  The ST takes the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span>'s kill choices and informs the actual Demon that the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> player is their <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> and who they chose.
  The Demon will then immediately know who the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> is.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> asks what character they are at any point while they have the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> ability,
  they should be told that they are the Demon that they were shown.
        </p>
          <p>
  If they lose the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> ability through a further execution,
  then they are treated exactly as they would have been had that execution occurred without a <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> execution beforehand.
  They are not told about no longer being a Demon but if they ask what character they are, they should be told that they are the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span>, 
  with nothing confirmed about why they were told that they were a Demon.
        </p>
          <p>
  All of this assumes that the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> is not droisoned.  If they ate an evil player then they can be lied to about their ability.
  And on a script with the <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span> or the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> and the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span>, it is possible for the <span class="Townsfolk">Cannibal</span> to believe that they really are the Demon.

  The <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> must be believe that they are a Townsfolk which at setup is achieved by substituting the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> token with another Townsfolk token.
  It is due to the physical limitations of the game that the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> tends to see an out of play Townsfolk; most roles only come with one token.
  <span class="Townsfolk">Village Idiot</span> is an exception.
  However, should the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> be created mid game they can legally see an in play token, although they probably should not.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes.  Anything that the Demon could be told based on the characters on the script can be told to the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> to aid with their deception.
        </p>
          <p>
  The <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> can be told that they were exorcised when the <span class="Townsfolk">Exorcist</span>:
<ul><li>
   picked them,
</li><li>
   did not pick them,
</li><li>
   is not even in play.
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  A fake exorcism means that the Demon does not learn of the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s choice(s), because the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> did not make any. 
  The Demon would not know why this is, as it is indistinguishable from the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> just being drunk or poisoned that night.
        </p>
          <p>
  The ST must be cautious: if the <span class="Townsfolk">Exorcist</span> is in play they might publicly claim who they picked, 
  and if this differs to what the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> was told,
  then this could be detrimental to the evil team.

          <p>Yes. Starpassing does not change the <span class="Demon">Imp</span>’s character, just makes them dead and creates a new <span class="Demon">Imp</span>.

  Some abilities specify 'the' Demon, which refers to the actual Demon, and these abilities target any alive Demons first,

          <p>No, because the <span class="Outsider">Goon</span> was out of play at the time of the pick so was not targeted.

  The players will not know for sure if the ST added the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> on top of the base Outsider count, but generally the <span class="Townsfolk">Huntsman</span> does not.
  The decision could depend on how weak or strong the good and evil characters that are in play.
  Players would likely prefer you swap an existing Outsider, as the other option is far too much of a downside for good and essentially removes two Townsfolk for nothing.

          <p>With the <span class="Townsfolk">Huntsman</span>'s ability, the ST:

        </p>
          <p>
  In a <span class="Townsfolk">Huntsman</span> <span class="Minion">Godfather</span> game, the Outsider count could be anywhere between one and four in a base two Outsider game:
   1 Outsider: The <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span>. The <span class="Minion">Godfather</span> removed an Outsider
   2 Outsiders: The <span class="Minion">Godfather</span> removed an Outsider and the <span class="Townsfolk">Huntsman</span> changed a Townsfolk into the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span>.
   3 Outsiders: The <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span> is already in play and the <span class="Minion">Godfather</span> added an Outsider.
   4 Outsiders: <span class="Minion">Godfather</span> added an Outsider and the <span class="Townsfolk">Huntsman</span> changed a Townsfolk into the <span class="Outsider">Damsel</span>.

          <p>
  When a player is drunk or poisoned, they are deceived into believing that their ability is working normally.
  The first part of the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s ability is a "you think" ability, which means deceiving the player about what they are.  
  So a drunk or poisoned <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> is deceived into believing that their ability is working normally ... which is to believe that they are some other character.
  So nothing has changed.
        </p>
          <p>
  However, drunkeness or poisoning does shut down the other mechanical part of their ability,
  which is to inform the Demon of their picks.

  When the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> is Pit-Hagged into a Demon, they only have to be told their new role.
  They were good and are still good, so their alignment has not changed.
  If it is a new player, it might be helpful for the ST to tell them their alignment, but for experienced players this is not necessary.
  If the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> actually turned evil due to a <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> jump then they would learn they are now evil.
        </p>
          <p>
  In general, players only learn when their alignment changes,
  and if a player were to enquire about their alignment should be told something like "your alignment has not changed".

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes, but this can lead to the ST controlling the kills:
<ul><li>
   the ST chooses a kill for the fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> and informs the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>, 
</li><li>
   the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> attacks the fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>'s target to keep up the lie,
</li><li>
   the Demon attacks the same target to keep up the lie.

          <p>
  The ST can do this if their group is cool with the idea

        </p>
          <p>
  How to simulate the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> to the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> without dictating the kills:
<ul><li>
   have the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> think that they are, for example, the <span class="Demon">Po</span></li><li>
   the actual Demon is the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span>, and is shown to the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> as their fake <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> (Demons never know what Demon their <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> thinks they are)
</li><li>
   N1, the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> (actual Demon) picks player X
</li><li>
   N2, the ST tells the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> that their <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> (actual Demon) just tried to kill player X
</li><li>
   and so on. Because the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> kills out of sync, the issue is solved.

  The TPI consider 'yes, they can' and 'no, they cannot' to both be valid rulings, so the ST should pick their preference and inform their players which they run:
<ol><li>
   The <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> cannot think they are the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> as the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> thinks they are evil,
    which contradicts the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> thinking they are good,
    so the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> cannot be the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>.
</li><li>
   The <span class="Minion">Marionette</span> can think they are a good character that themselves thinks they are the Demon. 
</li></ol></p>
          <p>
  If the preference is 'no they cannot' and the Demon lands between the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> and a Minion then, if there is no <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> in the game, that would need a rerack.
  To prevent this from happening an alternative setup should be used,
  such as placing an extra Townsfolk token in the bag instead of the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>,
  then after the tokens are distributed,
  deciding which of the Townsfolk players to make the <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>,
  informing that they are a Demon from the script

  It is still best to inform the actual Demon of the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>,
  not the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span>,
  otherwise that would out a player who does not even know that they are evil to a good player.

          <p>
  One possible way to avoid this scenario:
<ol><li>
   When preparing the bag the ST places two Minion tokens and no Demon token.
</li><li>
   Choose two adjacent players who drew good tokens to be the Demon and the <span class="Minion">Marionette</span>.

   Give the Demon the character that they drew as one of their bluffs, to avoid giving them a free fourth bluff

  If, upon the execution of a Demon, causing there to be a ‘<span class="Minion">Mastermind</span> day’,

          <p>No, because the <span class="Townsfolk">Mathematician</span> counts how many abilities malfunctioned,

          <p>The <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span>’s arbitrary death ability allows the ST to kill any player and protect any player from death.

          <p>

  The ability is not gained and the <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span>'s once per game ability is now spent, but the trade off is they have learnt an in play role.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>They can and there are reasons for doing so:
<ul><li>
   to turn an alive player into that role requires it being out of play first, such as removing a dead <span class="Minion">Assassin</span> allows a new <span class="Minion">Assassin</span> the next night;
</li><li>
   they could be possibly revived or picked by another player that night;
</li><li>
   turning someone into the <span class="Outsider">Politician</span> still allows them to turn;
</li><li>
   turning someone into the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> when they expect to be <span class="Townsfolk">Professor</span> revived, can be awesome to cause confusion.

  The <span class="Demon">Pukka</span>'s kills always die poisoned.
  This is what allows the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> to kill characters such as the <span class="Townsfolk">Sailor</span> or the <span class="Townsfolk">Fool</span> who might otherwise survive thanks to their own ability.
        </p>
          <p>
  But dying poisoned also means that effects which trigger upon death malfunction meaning for example that:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> is not offered the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> swap when the <span class="Outsider">Barber</span> dies
</li><li>
   a good player is not drunked when the <span class="Outsider">Sweetheart</span> dies

   the evil team do not learn each other when the <span class="Townsfolk">Poppy Grower</span> dies
</li></ul></p>
          <p>
  But while those were all bad for team evil, consider:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span> does not create another <span class="Townsfolk">Farmer</span></li><li>

  The <span class="Townsfolk">Exorcist</span> only stops the Demon to wake to use their ability,

  In this case, the <span class="Townsfolk">Exorcist</span> causes the <span class="Demon">Pukka</span> to not wake to choose a player,

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Either:

  Their ability reads "1 player is drunk, even if you die", rather than "even if you are dead",

  The <span class="Outsider">Puzzlemaster</span> must be alive to drunk a player and when they die continue to drunk that player,

          <p>Technically, yes; however, this makes the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> into the good <span class="Demon">Imp</span>, meaning that they need only to get themselves killed in order to win.

          <p>No.

        </p>
          <p>
  Think of registering as: if an ability "asks" a player about their character or alignment or living status, they can "answer" with something other than what they are.
  Misregistering can never change the game directly (like executing someone).
  It can however trick someone else's ability into doing it for them,
  like the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> who nominates the <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span> - the <span class="Minion">Spy</span>'s ability cannot kill themselves, but it can trick the <span class="Townsfolk">Virgin</span>'s ability into thinking they are a Townsfolk,

        <div class="answer">
          <p>No.

          <p>
  The ST is not allowed to lie to the player about their character or alignment unless the ability allows for that specifically (like <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span>, for example).

  The ST could never falsely tell the <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span> they are evil, a Minion, or a Demon.
  The <span class="Outsider">Recluse</span>'s ability of possibly registering as evil does not allow them to believe that they are the Demon.
  This is opposed to the wording on the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> or <span class="Outsider">Lunatic</span> which specifically say they believe they are something else.

        <div class="answer">

          <p>
  The <span class="Demon">Lil' Monsta</span> adds +1 Minion because the Monsta token does not actually go into the bag; the extra Minion is dealt so that there are the correct number of evil players.
  In the case of <span class="Demon">Riot</span>, the correct number of evil tokens go into the bag because the ST adds that many <span class="Demon">Riot</span> tokens, so there is no need to add an extra Minion.

          <p>
  Just to clarify:
<ul><li>

  The ST makes the decision on regurgitation before the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span> wakes,

          <p>If the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span> chose two people the night before, then just before they attack tonight, one of those people they chose, if they are currently dead, may come back to life.
  Note that if the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span> is chosen by an <span class="Townsfolk">Exorcist</span> and does not wake to attack anyone tonight, they can still bring one of their previous night's targets back to life

  Note that the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span>'s previous targets do not need to have been killed by the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span>'s attack in order to be revived,
  they only need to be dead on the next night.
  This means that the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span> can choose someone who is already dead and revive them the next night,
  or the <span class="Demon">Shabaloth</span>'s target can survive the attack,

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Any time before they die, and before the day officially ends.
  So after they are on the block but before they are actually executed is fine.
  Most STs also allow a few seconds for day abilities between the execution and officially declaring the day over and night beginning,

        </p>
          <p>
  If the <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span>-SC acts first and becomes the Demon, 
  then the old Demon becomes a poisoned <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span> and the actual SC becomes sober
  (Why would the original <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span> become sober? 
   Because the Philo causing them to be drunk is no longer in play; we have a new instance of the Philo)
  Now the <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span> can also choose the new Demon (the game's starting Philo) and swap to the Demon
  ... giving the possibility of one player (the OG <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span>) going from good Philo to evil Demon to good self poisoned SC.
  What happens to the OG demon (who became the self poisioned Philo)?
  The original Demon would still be the self poisoned <span class="Townsfolk">Philosopher</span>, the second snake charming would not change that.
        </p>
          <p>
  Depending on the kind of game the ST likes to run and the group of players would like to experience, 
  generally it would be recommended to have the Philo-drunk <span class="Townsfolk">Snake Charmer</span> choose first to prevent this overload of shenanigans.

  Since showing her the correct Grimoire works against the idea of the <span class="Minion">Spy</span> malfunctioning,

          <p>No, the drunking due to the VI ability is a setup effect.
  Also, gaining the VI ability does not make a player the VI, and the drunking specifically targets a VI.

  Droisoned players can never affect the state of the game,
  even if that means they immediately realize they are droisoned.
  Maintaining the illusion for that one player is less important than maintaining the basic principle that droisoned players have no ability
  and therefore cannot affect the state of the game.

          <p>
  A player can be executed without dying, and there are some abiltiies that work interestingly around this concept.

  In full, the ST's options are:

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Either. The way <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span> arbitrary deaths works is that the ST can block any kills (or not), and can cause new kills originating from the <span class="Minion">Pit-Hag</span>.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The ST can allow the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> to jump.
        </p>
          <p>
  ..ST's options are as follows, assuming the new <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> chooses an Outsider when deaths are arbitrary:
        </p>
          <p>
  If the new <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span> targets an Outsider then, since deaths are arbirtary, the choices are:
<ol><li>
   the chosen Outsider is PH protected and does not die;
</li><li>
   the chosen Outsider is PH protected and does not die, but then is PH killed, so no jump;
</li><li>
   the chosen Outsider dies to the <span class="Demon">Fang Gu</span>, so the jump happens.
</li></ol></p>
          <p>
  "Deaths are arbitrary" means the ST can allows deaths go go through, or not go through.
  So if the ST allows the Demon's choice to go through, that one is an attack from the Demon, not the PH,
  and if the ST blocks it, then it is treated similarly to the player being protected from the demon that night.
  Any "additional" deaths are considered attacks from the PH.

        <h4 class="question">If a player that wakes at night is drunk or poisoned, could the ST just skip them?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>No, drunk / poisoned players are never skipped. The ST should deceive them that their abilities are functioning normally,

        <h4 class="question">Reminder tokens are placed/removed regardless of drunkenness or poisoning:
<ul><li>
   a drunk <span class="Townsfolk">Juggler</span> will still place "correct" reminder tokens,
</li><li>
   a drunk <span class="Townsfolk">Gossip</span> will still place its "dies tonight" token,
</li><li>
   a <span class="Townsfolk">Minstrel</span> will still place its "everyone drunk" token, etc.
</li></ul>
  The drunkenness/poisoning simply disables the ability that makes these tokens do anything.
  So what happens when the normal flow of an ability (place when needed, remove when checked at night phase) is interrupted, such as by droisoning or by a character change?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>A more broad rule of thumb:
  If the player was drunk/poisoned at the time of their ability then a token is not placed,
  and if no token is placed then it cannot "come back."
        </p>
          <p>
  If a token was placed and that is interrupted by drunk/poison and then the drunk/poison goes away,
  then the effect of the token comes back.
        </p>
          <p>
  However, backward looking roles are run differently,
  with their tokens placed down for the ST's benefit.
  Abilities like the <span class="Townsfolk">Juggler</span>, <span class="Townsfolk">Gossip</span>, <span class="Townsfolk">Mathematician</span>, <span class="Townsfolk">Town Crier</span>, and Flower Girl have reminder tokens
  that essentially do not actually take effect until the night phase
  and putting them down during the day is just to make the night easier for the ST.
  That is why the ST still tracks them,
  because when the info/mechanical part of their ability truly goes off,
  they need to know in case the character is not drunk/poisoned.
  It does not matter if they were droisoned when the tokens were being placed,
  as long as they are sober and healthy at the time they get their info, it will be correct.
  Conversely, if they were sober and healthy when the tokens were placed, 
  and droisoned at the time of getting their info, the info is arbitrary.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Endless drunk/poison loops are resolved by having all parties drunked/poisoned, until one effect wears off as it normally would.

  Or would that be too powerful and against the never reveal the <span class="Outsider">Drunk</span> unofficial rule?
      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>With drunkenness and poisoning, the goal is for the ST to still pretend their ability is still working,

        <div class="answer">
          <p>If droison would be applied while the character is themselves droisoned, it is not.

          <p>This will likely depend on the source of the protection and the order of the Demon's picks.

          <p>
  If that player is protected due to their own ability (sober <span class="Townsfolk">Sailor</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Soldier</span>) then they cannot die no matter who else dies that night.
        </p>
          <p>
  If the protection is due to another player (<span class="Townsfolk">Tea Lady</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Innkeeper</span> / <span class="Townsfolk">Monk</span>) then that player cannot die, as long as source of the protection remains alive.
  This means who and the order of the Demon's picks is important:
<ul><li>
   If the source was not selected by the Demon, the protected player cannot die.
</li><li>
   If the source was selected after the protected player, the protected player survives but then the source, barring any other forms of protection, will die.

    and the target of their protection is no longer safe.

          <p>
  In the case of the Al-Had, if all three players choose live, or all three are alive at the end of their choices, then all three die in the order that they were selected.
  Again, the order of death matters: the protected player survives if the source of the protection was picked afterwards (or not at all).

        <div class="answer">
          <p>The ST should not consider this a madness break.

  Player A is doing that in an attempt to convince the town that they are not mad, and the intent and sincerity of their madness is still retained.
  Intent matters a lot more for madness than the words someone says.
        </p>
          <p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>No, setup abilities have no effect if they come into play after setup.
  Generally, when a player gains an ability mid game, any "you start knowing x" or "X knows who you are" happen, but any [setup ability] does not.

  The ST only announces visible changes to a player's life/death status.

          <p>No, most of the time.
        </p>
          <p>
  The player is not informed, nor is there an announcement in the morning, since the ST only announces visible changes to a player's life/death status.
  So any player who is revived and killed in the same night is unlikely to learn this.
  Exceptions:
<ul><li>
   the <span class="Townsfolk">Ravenkeeper</span> getting another use of their ability may surmise that they were revived and killed in the same night;

        <div class="answer">
          <p>ST choice. 
        </p>
          <p>
  For example a resurrected <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> is treated as a new <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> and can get a new grandchild.
  If a new one is assigned, only the new grandchild being killed by the Demon triggers her death.
  Additionally, the new grandchild could be dead, protecting the <span class="Townsfolk">Grandmother</span> from being able to trigger their own death.
        </p>
          <p>
  For other first night info characters, if the info has not changed, they should technically be wakened and given the same info.
  It matters for several reasons, including droison, dying later, or being checked by the <span class="Townsfolk">Chambermaid</span>.

          <p>
  The <span class="Townsfolk">Professor</span> already acts after the poisoning and killing roles act,

        </p>
          <p>
  A dead N1 role may be revived by the <span class="Demon">Al-Hadikhia</span> but then die again because all three chosen players picked live.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Ability trumps over general game rule.
  So if two abilities cause a game tie, then the good one will win. If there is an ability game end condition and a regular game end condition, the ability wins out. 
  If two regular game end conditions are met at once, it is a tie and good wins.

      </h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes.
  In general, there can only be a maximum of the amount of Outsiders that are on the script, because players cannot have duplicate tokens.
