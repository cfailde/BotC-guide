H Al-Hadikhia with the Mastermind
D Only one jinxed character can be in play. Evil players start knowing which player and character it is.


P Al-Hadikhia with the Choirboy
I Order is important, so if the King chooses to die and is able to do so,
  the Choirboy would be woken and told which player is the Demon,
  even if the Choirboy chooses to die later in the Al-Hadikhia’s selections.


P Al-Hadikhia with the Courtier
I Not particularly fun to put in scripts with the Al-Hadikhia – everyone will know the Al-Hadikhia is in play by day 2
  and it is a no-brainer to pick them at that point,
  which is completely unbluffable by the evil team and a Courtier will
  thus always be confirmed and get to wipe out the Al-Hadikhia for three nights.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Exorcist
I Indistinguishable from the Al-Hadikhia being drunk/poisoned from the Town’s point of view,
  the Al-Hadikhia just does not get to choose that night and so no announcement is made.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Farmer
I There can be multiple living good Famers if the Farmer dies (creating another Farmer)
  and then is resurrected by the Al-Hadikhia.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Gambler
I The Gambler does not know if they have died to their own ability.
  As a result, they could gamble incorrectly and die,
  then be chosen by the Al-Hadikhia and choose live
  and therefore be resurrected and would not know whether they gambled correctly or not as the net effect is the same.





P Al-Hadikhia with the Grandmother
I If the grandchild dies to the Al-Hadikhia,
  the Grandmother dies too, but similar to the Gambler,
  can then be resurrected in the same night and therefore not know if their ability worked or not.

  If the grandchild is the first Al-Hadikhia pick and chooses to die, also killing the Grandmother,
  and the Grandmother is the second pick and chooses to live so coming back to life,
  then they could get a new grandchild, which is not recommended as this gives them too much confirmation.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Innkeeper
I The Innkeeper, like the Sailor can drunk the Al-Hadikhia but this probably should not happen,
  as if there are not many reasons for the Al-Hadikhia to be blocked 
  then it is fairly academic to execute both Innkeeper targets and the evil team cannot bluff this with just the Al-Hadikhia ability.

  If an Innkeeper protected player is picked by the Al-Hadikhia and chooses die when the other two picks both pick live,
  then she cannot die due to the Innkeeper's protection,
  so lives despite choosing death and the other two live as they chose life.
  As all three would be alive, all three should die in the order they were picked.
  Again, however, the Innkeeper's protection means that she cannot die, so only the other two would now die,
  unless the Innkeeper dies to the Al-Hadikhia first meaning that their targets are no longer protected.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Klutz
I Although the Klutz might choose death on being woken for their Al-Hadikhia choice,
  she does not actually know if she died until it is announced in the morning as she could be protected by another character,
  so her choice would happen publicly in the morning.



P Al-Hadikhia with the Lunatic
I If the Lunatic thinks they are the Al-Hadikhia,
  their choices are shown to the real Demon. 
  Obviously this means that if the real Demon is a different Demon,
  the Lunatic will find out immediately.



P Al-Hadikhia with the Mathematician
I If a Soldier or one of the other protective characters prevents an Al-Hadikhia kill,
  this registers to the Mathematician as a malfunction.
  It does not, however, register for the Fool if they end up dying twice to the Al-Hadikhia in the same night as the Fool ability has worked as intended.
  So the Fool dying twice would give a 1 to the Mathematician for the Al-Hadikhia ability but not the Fool ability.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Mayor
I The Mayor can bounce an Al-Hadikhia kill from themselves to another player if they choose to die.
  This, like the Soldier interaction, can result in all three players being alive at the end of the Al-Hadikhia activation,
  which can result in all three players dying.
  Which, again, the Mayor can bounce.
  
  So Mayor and players A and B can be chosen by Al-Hadikhia and announced to town, then Mayor says die and bounces to C, who dies,
  then all three should die because A and B said live and all three are therefore alive, so the Mayor can bounce again to D,
  leaving A, B, C and D as dying in the night despite only Mayor, A and B being announced as Al-Hadikhia targets.

  If the ST were do this though it would all-but hard-confirm the Mayor and the Al-Hadikhia cannot easily stop them surviving to F3, but it is a fun interaction!

P Al-Hadikhia with the Moonchild
I Although the Moonchild might choose death on being woken for their Al-Hadikhia choice,
  she does not actually know if she died until it is announced in the morning as she could be protected by another character,
  so her choice would happen publicly in the morning.

P Al-Hadikhia with the  Philosopher
I The order of the Al-Hadikhia's picks is relevant – Philo-drunking can be removed by being killed before the original of the character,
  so it is possible, for example, for a Philo-Ravenkeeper and an actual Ravenkeeper to both be killed by the Al-Hadikhia on the same night and both get sober info,
  provided they are killed in that order.

  If the Philo dies, the ability they previously gained is lost and therefore if they are resurrected they are resurrected without any abilities other than the Philosopher.
  If the Philo died while they had an "even if dead" ability that ability is maintained while they are dead, however, when any character is resurrected,
  they are treated as being newly created, so no abilities are maintained.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Pixie
I The order of the Al-Hadikhia's picks is relevant – the Pixie can gain her ability after the original of the character,
  so it is possible, for example, for the Ravenkeeper and the Pixie Ravenkeeper to both be killed by the Al-Hadikhia on the same night and both get info,
  provided they are killed in that order.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Pit-Hag
I If a new Demon is made and one of the two is an Al-Hadikhia who is not immediately killed before they awake,
  then the Al-Hadikhia can be woken and their choices taken, announced and processed,
  but the ST can choose to kill or protect anyone throughout the process using the Pit-Hag ability.
  
  It is generally a good idea to kill the Al-Hadikhia if they or a second Demon in an Al-Hadikhia game are created by the Pit-Hag
  as otherwise they can resurrect the other Demon relatively easily and have two living evil Demons.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Poppy Grower
I If killed by the Al-Hadikhia, the evil team learn each other immediately.
  Generally, if this is not going to affect the other Al-Hadikhia choices,
  then it is safe to wait until after the other choices to tell the evil players,
  but if a Minion or, worryingly, two, have been picked by the Al-Hadikhia along with the Poppy Grower,
  then the ST should tell them before waking them for their Al-Hadikhia choice as it will affect their decision.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Sailor
I The Sailor, like the Innkeeper can drunk the Al-Hadikhia but this probably should not happen.

  If the sober Sailor is picked by the Al-Hadikhia and chooses die when the other two picks both choose live,
  then she cannot die due to her ability, 
  so lives despite choosing death and the other two live as they chose life.
  As all three would be alive, all three die in the order they were picked.
  Again, however, the Sailor cannot die, so only the other two would now die.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Soldier
I If the Soldier is picked by the Al-Hadikhia and chooses die when the other two picks both pick live,
  then she cannot die due to her ability,
  so lives despite choosing death and the other two live as they chose life.
  As all three would be alive, all three should die in the order they were picked.
  Again, however, the Soldier cannot die, so only the other two would now die.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Storm Catcher
I The Storm Caught player can be picked by the Al-Hadikhia but cannot die.
  This can be a way to force a good player who does not want to die to do so,
  because it reduces the field to the Storm Caught player and two characters who do not want to die,
  one of whom is going to have to choose to do so or both of them will instead.


P Al-Hadikhia with the Sweetheart
I The Sweetheart drunks someone as soon as they die.
  So could drunk a character that dies later within the Al-Hadikhia choices or even the Al-Hadikhia herself, 
  immediately ending har activation at that moment but
  this is a probably a bad idea as it confirms the Sweetheart as good as well as wiping out the Demon ability.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Tea Lady
I If the Tea Lady's neighbour is picked by the Al-Hadikhia and chooses die when the other two picks both pick live,
  then she cannot die due to the Tea Lady's protection,
  so lives despite choosing death and the other two live as they chose life.
  As all three would be alive, all three should die in the order they were picked.
  Again, however, the Tea Lady's protection means that she cannot die, so only the other two would now die.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Tinker
A The Tinker can choose to live for their Al-Hadikhia choice,
  then die before the other players have made their choices,
  ensuring that one of the three is dead and preventing an "all three die" situation.

  The ST probably would not do this because
  * either the Tinker will generally be happy to say die
  * or it would be harsh on the Al-Hadikhia who was about to get a rare triple kill.





P Al-Hadikhia with the Undertaker
I If the Undertaker is dead during the day and there is an execution,
  then she is resurrected by the Al-Hadikhia that night, she gets woken to be told the character of the executee.

P Al-Hadikhia with the Widow
I If the Widow is resurrected by the Al-Hadikhia,
 they immediately wake to see the grimoire and choose a player to be poisoned. 
 This does not have to happen in between the Al-Hadikhia kills,
 but should if their choice of poison could affect what happens when the other players selected by the Al-Hadikhia that night make their choices.
 A good player should also be told that a Widow is in play.







P Alchemist with the Marionette
I Giving the Alchemist the Marionette ability should be avoided as it is unfun and uninteresting.
  In both cases (the Alchemist who gains the Marionette ability or the Marionette who thinks they are the Alchemist) 
  they are effectively a poisoned/drunk Alchemist and are told the wrong ability that has no effect.
  In both cases the Demon would learn who the Marionette is and would be their neighbour.
  If it is the Alchemist with the Marionette ability,
  the Demon would immediately know this as they would not have been shown them as a Minion during Demon info.

P Balloonist with the Goon
I The Goon is not chosen by the Balloonist, merely shown to the Balloonist, so does not make the Balloonist drunk and is a valid player to show.

P Balloonist with the Legion
I A single Legion player can be shown to the Balloonist twice – once as a Minion and once as a Demon.

P Balloonist with the Lil’ Monsta
I A Minion babysitting Lil’ Monsta can be shown to the Balloonist twice – once as a Minion and once as a Demon.
  Noteably the Spy babysitting Lil’ Monsta could be shown to the Balloonist for four nights – 
  the Spy registers as Townsfolk, then Outsider, then as themselves the Spy/Minion,
  then as the Demon/Lil’ Monsta. 
  But this does confirm them to be the Spy holding Lil’ Monsta so although fun is probably not something to actually do.

P Balloonist with the Preacher
I A Minion that has no ability is still a Minion, so can be shown to the Balloonist as such.

P Balloonist with the Recluse
I The Recluse can register three times to the Balloonist, as an Outsider, a Minion and the Demon.

P Balloonist with the Snake Charmer
I The SC can be shown to the Balloonist twice, once before and once after hitting the Demon.

P Balloonist with the Spy
I Can register three times to the Balloonist, as a Townsfolk, an Outsider and a Minion.



P Boomdandy with the Cult Leader
I RAW the Cult Leader can call for a cult in the one minute time if they are still alive and did not call for a cult earlier in the day,
  but this should be disallowed as it is either going to go over the time limit or take up a disproportionate amount of the time limit which is intended for discussion.

P Boomdandy with the Fool
I The Fool cannot be killed twice by the Boomdandy boom,
  so, if their ability is unused, they will survive,
  but if they are "killed" once by by the boom and then killed again by the pointing, they would die.

P Boomdandy with the Gossip
I The Gossip can gossip during the minute if they have not already that day, but this is probably pointless and not advised.

P Boomdandy with the Mayor
I The Mayor cannot win the game if no-one dies from the Boomdandy pointing, 
  as even though there are three alive at the end of the day,
  the Boomdandy was executed earlier that day.

P Boomdandy with the Minstrel
I As soon as the Boomdandy is executed and dies they are made drunk by the Minstrel,
  so the rest of their ability does not happen.

P Boomdandy with the Philosopher
I If the Philo dies to the Boomdandy 
  then the character they philo-drunked might become sober.

P Boomdandy with the Pixie
I The Pixie might gain an ability through their target Townsfolk dying.

P Boomdandy with the Sailor
I The sober Sailor on the day the Boomdandy is executed, cannot die, so must remain alive.

P Boomdandy with the Slayer
I The Slayer may act during the minute after the Boomdandy's kills are announced.
  As this is extraordinarily powerful in this context, the unused Slayer should probably die to the Boomdandy.


P Boomdandy with the Acrobat
I The Acrobat ability is only checked at night,
  so if the Acrobat survives into the living three and one of the other two living players is drunk or poisoned,
  the Acrobat would not die until that night.

P Boomdandy with the Goon
I The Goon is not turned evil nor do they make the Boomdandy drunk as the Boomdandy is not choosing the Goon with their ability.

P Boomdandy with the Klutz
I At whatever point you declare the Klutz is dead, the Klutz should interject to choose an alive (at that point) player. See "Thoughts on who to kill” for more on this.

P Boomdandy with the Moonchild
I Like the Klutz, when the Moonchild is declared dead, they should interject to choose an alive (at that point) player.  Unlike the Klutz though it is less critical for the game as to what they do.

Q After the Boomdandy goes boom resulting in only three players left alive,
  can a player who is mad (Mutant / Cerenovus target / Harpy target / ...) still be executed for breaking madness?
A Yes.
  This will almost certainly end the game as it will likely leave only two living players (the Boomdandy’s resulting three minus the mad player).

P Boomdandy with the Sweetheart
I The Sweetheart makes someone drunk when they die.
  Usually this should be a player that is also dying to the Boomdandy ability.
  They could drunk the Boomdandy to immediately stop the killing of people and move the game straight to night without any pointing,
  but this is a terrible idea as it is using an Outsider to help the good team immensely, and confirming both a good and evil player in the process.

P Boomdandy with the Tinker
I The Tinker could survive the Boomdandy and then die immediately afterwards to end the game in evil’s favour.
  This is a dick ST move.

P Boomdandy with the Devil’s Advocate
I If the Boomdandy is executed but does not die, they still proc.
  As this hard-confirms them as the Boomdandy, it is a good idea to make sure the Boomdandy is one of the ones that dies due to their own ability.

P Boomdandy with the Evil Twin
I If you leave both twins alive as well as the Demon for the Boomdandy 3,
  evil guaranteed wins.
  You can, if you choose, just leave the two twins and a third party alive, 
  to make the Boomdandy choice which of the two twins dies. See "Thoughts on who to kill” for more.

P Boomdandy with the Scarlet Woman
I If the Boomdandy deaths happen in the right order,
  the SW can become the Demon,
  as long as the Demon died with more than four alive.

P Boomdandy with the Lil’ Monsta
I If the Boomdandy is babysitting and there is no Scarlet Woman or Evil Twin pair alive,
  the game ends because even if there are kills down to three alive,
  the Demon is dead.
  
  However, if there is a Scarlet Woman, the Demon would jump.   
  If there is an Evil Twin pair alive,
  the Demon can be dead and there would just be three alive including both twins.
  In both cases, all deaths are caused by the Demon, so all the Demon-death abilities would be relevant again. (Soldier / Grandmother / ...)

P Boomdandy with the Lleech
I The Lleech can be killed by killing the host, so only applicable with an Evil Twin pair.
  Otherwise the Lleech and their host both have to be in the final three.
  
  The Lleech player can be attacked using the Boomdandy ability and left alive,
  resulting in four left alive after all the kills have gone through.

  Do not kill the host and therefore the Lleech if a Scarlet Woman is in play as that results in a broken situation where the SW-turned-Lleech should have a host,
  but has not yet had a chance to choose one and so cannot die.
  This would guarantee an evil win in almost all situations as the SW-turned-Lleech will pick a host from the remaining living players that night,
  then kill a different player to win.

P Boomdandy with the Zombuul
I The Zombuul would be single-killed by the Boomdandy ability and then there can be three other living players plus the once-dead Zombuul, 
  so the players would need to point to the appearing-dead Zombuul to kill them.
  As many players died that day, the Zombuul does not get to kill tonight,
  so even if the pointing results in a death, the town would definitely get one more day as there will be two living players plus an appearing-dead Zombuul.

P Boomdandy with the Apprentice
I The Apprentice should not be given the Boomdandy ability, as it does not do anything on exile.

P Boomdandy with the Barista
I If the Boomdandy is Barista-doubled on a day they are not executed, nothing happens.

  On a day they are executed, they try to kill N (number of total players) minus 3,
  then try to kill N minus 3 players again (these do not need to be the same players),
  then when the pointing minute is complete, the player with the most pointing at them dies twice (if applicable).
  Note this means that a Barista-doubled Boomdandy can kill an unused Fool before the pointing starts
  or a living Zombuul/unused Fool can be killed twice to end the game with the pointing.

P Boomdandy with the Butcher
I The Butcher can nominate again after a Boomdandy activation on the main execution of the day.
  This is usually the only way the good team can save themselves from an accidental tie in the Boomdandy pointing.
  However, this requires there to have been some other reason for more than three players to be alive after the Boomdandy kills
  as ordinarily if there was a Butcher and two others left alive, the game would end with an evil win.

P Boomdandy with the Deviant
I The Deviant can die to the Boomdandy as it is not an exile.

P Boomdandy with the Gangster
I The Gangster can kill during the Boomdandy minute.
  However, this requires there to have been some other reason for more than three players to be alive after the Boomdandy kills
  as ordinarily if there was a Gangster and two others left alive, the game would end with an evil win.

P Boomdandy with the Doomsayer
I The only time a player can Doomsay during the Boomdandy minute is if there are more than three players left alive for whatever reason
  as in all other cases there will only be three players living and therefore the Doomsayer has no ability.





P Bounty Hunter with the Barista
I The Bounty Hunter affected by a Barista 2 could learn two evil players in one night.
  They would learn another player when either of those two players died.
  This means the Bounty Hunter has two instances of their ability from that point on - when either ‘client’ dies, they learn a new name. 
  It is usually a good idea to show them the same player after both "client A" and "client B" die, 
  to restore the Bounty Hunter to knowing only a single player at a time from then on.

P Bounty Hunter with the Cannibal
I An evil Townsfolk who dies by execution will poison the Cannibal.

  The Cannibal that gains the Bounty Hunter ability does not have to see a player the original Bounty Hunter saw.

P Bounty Hunter with the Courtier
I Even if they choose the Bounty Hunter on N1, they cannot prevent the Townsfolk being turned evil as this is a setup ability. 

P Bounty Hunter with the Cult Leader
I The Bounty Hunter cannot see the Cult Leader as their evil player on N1
  as the Cult Leader does not change alignment until the end of the night
  and therefore will always be good when the Bounty Hunter wakes even if they will be turning evil later tonight. 
  The only exception to this is if the Bounty Hunter themselves causes the Cult Leader to be turned evil at setup.

P Bounty Hunter with the Damsel
I If the evil Townsfolk guesses the Damsel, nothing happens, because they are not a Minion. The guess is not used.

P Bounty Hunter with the Dreamer
I Just because a Townsfolk is evil in a Bounty Hunter game,
  does not make that a legitimate "evil character" to show to the Dreamer,
  they should still see the relevant Townsfolk and a Minion/Demon token.

P Bounty Hunter with the Drunk/Marionette
I Whether the Bounty Hunter is the Drunk or Marionette must be decided before a Townsfolk is woken and told that they are evil
  (as a result of the Bounty Hunter ability).
  The Drunk and Marionette also are not valid Townsfolk to be turned evil through the Bounty Hunter ability.

P Bounty Hunter with the Engineer
I The evil Townsfolk is unaffected by the Engineer, as it is not a Minion or Demon.

P Bounty Hunter with the Farmer
I Even if the Farmer is evil, it is an alive good player that becomes the Farmer.

P Bounty Hunter with the Fool
I If the Fool is the player known to a Bounty Hunter,
  the Bounty Hunter will not learn another player until the Fool actually dies for good (the second time they die),
  as the first time a Fool dies, they "do not".

P Bounty Hunter with the Lil’ Monsta
I The evil Townsfolk is not a Minion and does not wake to choose the babysitter.

P Bounty Hunter with the Lleech
I If the Lleech picks the Bounty Hunter or the BH-evil Townsfolk as host,
  this does not stop a player being made evil through the BH ability – this is a [setup] ability and has already occurred.

P Bounty Hunter with the Magician
I The evil Townsfolk is unaffected by the Magician, as it is not a Minion or Demon.

P Bounty Hunter with the Mayor
I If no execution occurs while just three players including the Mayor live, and the Mayor is the evil Townsfolk, evil wins.

P Bounty Hunter with the No Dashii
I The No Dashii still poisons evil Townsfolk, their ability does not care about alignment.




P Bounty Hunter with the Revolutionary:
I The Revolutionary may cause a good player to register falsely, resulting in the Bounty Hunter learning them.

  Also, Revolutionary pairs are decided at setup, the same time as Bounty Hunter Evil Townsfolk.
  As such, if the two players in the pair are good, you cannot select either of them to become the Bounty Hunter evil Townsfolk.
  You could pair the evil Townsfolk with a Minion or Demon, however. 







P Cannibal with the Chambermaid 
I If the Chambermaid chooses the Cannibal that is waking due to having gained a night-waking ability,
  they register as waking to the Chambermaid.
  The ability that the Cannibal has gained is still the Cannibal’s own, despite having been copied from the recent executee.

P Cannibal with the Courtier
I If the Courtier chooses the character whose ability the Cannibal has,
  the Cannibal is not drunked as they are the Cannibal,
  not the character whose ability they currently have.

P Cannibal with the Mathematician
I If the Cannibal is poisoned by an evil player being executed,
  it is the Cannibal’s own ability that is poisoning them,
  so the Mathematician does not register this as a malfunction.

P Cannibal with the Snake Charmer
I If the Snake Charmer is executed and the good Cannibal picks the evil Demon,
  the Cannibal becomes an evil Demon and the Demon becomes a good poisoned Cannibal. 
  As is the case with the Philosopher-Snake Charmer, the former Demon now Cannibal is poisoned.

P Cannibal with the Politician
I If the Cannibal has the Politician ability,
  they are in competition with the actual now-dead Politician as only one player can be most responsible for their team losing,
  so only one can change alignment and win.

P Cannibal with the Snitch
I If the Cannibal gains the Snitch ability the Minions are woken that night and given three out-of-play characters which may or may not be the same ones they or the Demon received previously.

P Cannibal with the Cerenovus
I If a player is Cerenovus-mad about being a certain character,
  they cannot claim to be the Cannibal with the ability of that character and expect to be safe from execution
  as they are not claiming to actually be that character, which is the Cerenovus requirement.


P Cannibal with the Zombuul
I Counts as dying by execution for almost all purposes, including the Cannibal ability, so the Cannibal would be poisoned.

P The Choirboy with the Spy
I Technically the Spy can register as the King to the Choirboy if killed by the Demon
  and cause the Choirboy to learn the Demon’s identity. Probably not fun for anyone though.


P The Choirboy with the Lil’ Monsta
I The Choirboy would be shown the person babysitting Lil’ Monsta the rest of that night
  and the next day because Lil’ Monsta’s kill and therefore the Choirboy’s information comes after the babysitter is chosen.

P The Choirboy with the Pukka
I If the Pukka picks the King night N and the Choirboy Night N+1,
  the Choirboy is poisoned when the King dies and therefore can get arbitrary info that night before dying the following night.




=========
=Acrobat=
=========
Q Can the droisoned Acrobat die with one or more droisoned neighbours?
A No.  The Acrobat dies only at its turn in the night order. If they are drunk/poisoned at that time, they would not be able to die to their own ability.

Q Is the Marionette Townsfolk considered poisoned for the sake of the Acrobat?
A No, they are sober and healthy. Also, they are an evil Minion, and the Acrobat only cares about neighboring living good players.

Q If the Acrobat is sat next to a Minion what happens?
A The Acrobat's ability skips over evil and dead players,
  looking only at its nearest alive good players.

Q If the Acrobat has a droisoned neighbour N1 and then is between two sober people N2, do they still die?
  (for instance, they neighbour a drunk Sailor the first night who becomes sober the second)
A The Acrobat dies at their turn in the night order only, so if by then they are between two sober amd healthy players, they do not die.

===========
=Alchemist=
===========
Q Can the good Apprentice have the Alchemist so gain a Minion ability?
A Yes.

Q The Bounty Hunter turning the Alchemist evil ... that is just another Minion ability being used by evil, right?
A Yes.

Q The Alchemist Cerenovus picks a player.  What token is that player shown?
A Madness due to the Cerenovus or the Alchemist Cerenovus runs the same:
  the target is still shown the Cerenovus token, as well as the token of the role that they are mad as.

Q Does the Alchemist ping the Chambermaid when they learn what Minion ability they have?
A Yes.  After N1 they might still register to the Chambermaid, depending on the Minion ability.

Q How does the Alchemist Evil Twin work?
A The Alchemist ET learns an evil player and their role as their twin.  The evil player learns the Alchemist.
  If the good Alchemist ET is executed, evil wins.

Q What is announced when the Alchemist Fearmonger has picked a player?
A The announcement is the same as for the Fearmonger "A player has been chosen with the Fearmonger ability”.

Q Can the Alchemist get the Legion ability?
A No, Legion does not register as a Minion until it is in play.

Q Is it valid for the Alchemist Goblin's win condition for them to publicly claim to be the Alchemist Goblin rather than the Goblin?
A Yes.

  Technically the ability requires claiming to be the Goblin in order to win when executed,
  but it would be harsh to not treat both as valid claims.

Q The Philosopher chooses Alchemist N1 and gains the ability of the Godfather.
  The actual Alchemist is drunk and, as such, thinks they gain the ability of the in-play Witch.
  During the game, the Philospher dies and the Alchemist is no longer drunk.
  What happens to the Alchemist?
A The Alchemist is told nothing and the ST would start treating them as the ability they actually have after the drunkening wears off.

  They never had the Witch ability, so they are not changing abilities, so are not informed of an ability change.
  The (out of play Minion) ability they actually have, they had from setup, they were just informed incorrectly because of the drunking.
  Their ability is something they start knowing and can be drunked / poisoned like a start knowing character can get wrong info
  and will not be informed of the correct info if they become sober / healthy.

Q How does the Alchemist Mezepheles work?
  Could it turn an evil player good?
A The ability still works as it normally does - the first good player to say the word turns evil.

  The Alchemist can say it immediately and turn themselves evil,
  or they could not say it and not lead anyone else to say it
  and just play for the good team with the knowledge that there is no extra evil player in the game.

Q The Alchemist has the Baron ability, but on the second night, they get droisoned.
  Can they be told that the Baron has come into play, they now have the Poisoner ability, and for them to choose a player?
  Can they continue to be asked to choose players when made healthy?
A While droisoned, they can be told anything. Once they sober up, they must act as their actual ability does.

Q Does the drunk Alchemist Baron add Outsiders?
A No.

Q Does the Alchemist Godfather change outsider count?
A Yes, and learns which Outsiders are in play.

Q Does the Alchemist Baron change outsider count?
A Yes.

Q Does the Alchemist with a Minion ability like the Godfather or Baron change the outsider count?
A Yes, if they started the game with that ability then its setup effect happens.

  If they start the game with a Minion ability that has no setup effect
  and are later switched to having one that does,
  then the setup effects do not happen midgame.

Q What happens for an Alchemist if all Minion abilities on a script are in play?
A They duplicate an in play ability.

  This could happen for instance in a 14 player Lil' Monsta game, which results in four in play Minions -
  this is why it is better to have 5+ Minions on an Alchemist/Lil’ Monsta scripts to avoid such a scenario.

Q What happens if the Pit-Hag changes a player into the Alchemist but there is no out of play Minion abilities?
A If all Minion abilities are already in play, then the Alchemist will have the ability of an in-play Minion (ST's choice which)
  This is true whether an Alchemist gets made after all Minion abilities are put into play or an Alchemist has always been around.

Q Can the Minion the Alchemist has the ability of come into play due to the Pit-Hag or the Hatter?
A Yes. The Alchemist would change ability if there is still an out-of-play Minion ability available.

  If there is no out-of-play Minion ability remaining, 
  the Alchemist could either keep the same ability or change to a different in-play ability. 
  It should probably change to signal to the Alchemist that the corresponding Minion has entered play as is usually the case.

  If an Alchemist ever changes ability, they should be told by showing the "you are” token, followed by the Alchemist token and new Minion token.

Q Can the Alchemist Pit-Hag make a Pit-Hag?
A Yes, but then as the Alchemist no longer has an out-of-play minion ability, they must be given a new out-of-play Minion play.
  Unless all Minion abilities are in play, in which case it is ST choice whether to let the Alchemist keep the Pit-Hag ability or switch it.

Q Does an Alchemist wake up with Minions to decide who babysits little monster?
A No, the Alchemist is not a Minion.

Q An Alchemist Scarlet Woman with Legion - how exactly does this work? The last Legion player needs to die for the Alchemist to become Legion or any Legion?
A Any Legion.

Q If the Alchemist has the Vizier ability, do players know that they are the Alchemist?
A They are announced as the Vizier. The "everyone knows who you are" refers to the _ability_ they have.

  The same applies to Cannibal Nightwatchman, Philosopher King etc.

Q How does the Alchemist interact with the Marionette ability?
A From the experimental how to run:
  "Marionette: Do not make the Alchemist the Marionette if you can avoid it, it is not fun or interesting.
  In both cases (the Alchemist who gains the Marionette ability or the Marionette who thinks that they are the Alchemist)
  the only resolution is to just treat them as a poisoned/drunk Alchemist and tell them the wrong ability and not have it affect anyone.
  In both cases the Demon would learn who the Marionette is and would be their neighbour. 
  If it is an Alchemist with the Marionette ability, the Demon would immediately know this as they would not have been shown them as a Minion during Demon info."

Q The Alchemist Spy jinx is that the Alchemist cannot get the Spy ability, so if the only out-of-play Minion is the Spy, does the Alchemist get an in-play Minion ability instead?
A That is a reasonable solution.

Q Can the Alchemist-Scarlet Woman become the Demon?
A Yes.

Q If the Imp self kills, does the Alchemist-Scarlet Woman become the Imp?
A Yes. But also, as the Alchemist is not a Minion, a living Minion also becomes the Imp.

---three questions in one
Q The Alchemist Goblin is nominated, claims Goblin, and is not put on the block.  She then nominates the Virgin and is immediately executed.
  Does that end the game and give a win to the goood team?
  What about a good Goblin nominating the Virgin? What about an Alchemist Goblin breaking Cere madness?
A The Goblin's ability reads "If you publicly claim to be the Goblin when nominated and are executed that day, your team wins."
  So she does not have to be executed because of her nomination, but if she is executed the same day, that is a win for the good team.
  A good Goblin would not proc a Virgin as they are not a Townsfolk.  
  A generous ST could execute the Alchemist Goblin for breaking madness and give the good team the win.

Q If the Alchemist is dead when the Minion she has the ability for is put into play, is she still told she changed ability?
A No, because she no longer has the ability that would be giving her that an out-of-play Minion ability.
  But if she were to later come back to life, then she would be told she has a new ability,
  but she will not know if that is because that Minion has entered play while she was dead,
  or if the ST just gave her a different out-of-play Minion ability
  (since that resurrected Alchemist would be a new instance and can get a new ability so long as it is also out of play).

=============
=Al-Hadikhia=
=============
Q How does the Barista doubled Al-Hadikhia work?
A The entirety of the choosing and killing process happens twice:
  from the Al-Hadikhia choosing three players who decide to live/die to the end of the activation,
  then back to the start to do it again.

Q Does the Barista doubled target of the Al-Hadikhia get to choose to live or die twice?
A No, it is only that player's ability that is doubled, not the Al-Hadikhia’s.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns the Demon into the Al-Hadikhia, deaths are arbirtary, but should the ST wake the Al-Hadikhia and her targets?
A Deaths are arbirtary until the end of the night giving the ST a lot of freedom since Demons wake later than the Pit-Hag,
  but if the Al-Hadikhia is alive, sober and healthy
  then the waking up and announcing stuff is not optional: it must happen.

  This potentially already informs good players that the Demon has changed,
  so the ST might choose not to interfere with anything and ignore the option for arbitrary deaths.

Q Are the drunk / poisoned Al-Hadikhia's picks still woken?
A No, they are drunk / poisoned so they cannot affect other players: there is no annoucement and no waking of their targets.
  The Al-Hadikhia will then realise that they were drunk / poisoned or think that they might be the Lunatic.

Q If one of the Al-Hadikhia's targets is the unpicked Goon, what happens?
A The Al-Hadikhia is drunked immediately, so there are no announcements or waking of any of the targets who all live.

Q If the evil Goon is resurrected by the Al-Hadikhia, are they still evil?
A Yes.  Resurrection does not change alignment.

Q If the only Al-Hadikhia pick who chooses death is the unspent Fool, who dies?
A The Fool initially survives due to her ability, then as all three are alive, all die in the order they were picked.
  As this would now be the Fool's second death, she is killed outright. This all assumes no other sources of protection.

  Arguably the unspent Fool should always say no to dying...

Q In a final four, if the Barber, the Farmer and the last good/evil player are picked by the Al-Hadikhia and all choose live,
  does the Barber and the Farmer stuff still happen?
A Yes, in the order that they were picked.

  The players would die in the order the Al-Had chose them,
  with any on death abilities handled as they trigger,
  but the ST will end the game as soon as end game condition is met, 
  such as only two players left alive.
  So if the choices were the Farmer, the Barber, and another role in that order,
  the Farmer would die and someone would become the Farmer,
  then the player who was the Barber would die and the game would end. 

  If the Barber were first,
  the Al-Had would be offered the Barber swap,
  and if they swapped themselves then the rest of the kills would not happen.
  If they instead swapped the Barber with the Farmer,
  then the Farmer would not trigger and instead there would be another Barber swap.
  Theoretically there could be three Barber swaps.

Q If the Al-Hadikhia kills the Barber, when does the Barber swap happen?
A It can happen part way through waking their choices if the Barber chooses to die and is not the last player to choose.

  Should the Al-Had swap themselves while the picks are still being resolved,
  then the Al-Had ability would leave play and therefore no more players would be woken and live or die.

Q The Al-Hadikhia picks the Innkeeper and the two Innkeeper targets.
  If all choose live, do all die, or just the Innkeeper?
  If all three die at the same time, does the Innkeeper protection kick in?
A The Al-Had visits three players in an order over the night phase, offering them the choice to live or die.
  Any player picking die, dies instantly.
  Once all three are visited, a check is performed: are all three players alive?
  If they are all alive then,
  according to the current ruling,
  they are killed in the order that the Al-Had picked,
  and not simultaneously as some argue should be the case.

  So in this example if the Innkeeper was picked first, all three would die.
  If the Innkeeper was not the first choice, then the protected player(s) chosen beforehand would stay alive.

Q For Al-Hadikhia, do all deaths happen simultaneously (when all choose live) or do they happen in the order chosen?
A In the order chosen, like any multi-kill Demon.
  If a player chooses die they die immediately upon choosing so. If all players live, they each die in the order chosen. 

Q In an Al-Hadikhia game, do other players know who else was chosen? 
A Yes, they are announced publicly.
  The ST will announce, "The Al-Hadikhia has chosen X" then wake X for their choice of live or die.
  Then they do the same for the next two players chosen. All of this is done in player silence.
  So the first player chosen will not know who has been chosen second or third, and the second player chosen will not know who has been chosen third. But all players do learn.
  The ST also asks for silence during this time frame, so the only thing players will be hearing during this time (in terms of the game anyway) is the ST making said announcements.

Q If only three players live, one of them being the Al-Hadikhia, and the game moves to the night, does the game end?
A Almost certainly. The game ends as soon as an end condition is met, which can occur before a character ability has fully resolved.
  With just two players left alive the game ends so the game can end in the middle of the Al-Hadikhia's picks,
  which, as with the other multi-kill Demons, happen in order.
  
  If the Al-Hadikhia chooses the three living players with herself last, she is guaranteed to win as long as she says "live":
  If any of the two players before her say die, they die immediately and the game is over with only two players left alive, evil wins.
  If all say "live" then they die in order, so the first player dies leaving just two players left alive, the game is over and evil wins.

  If, instead to be safe, the Al-Hadikhia chooses the other two living players and a dead player,
  then if anyone says die the game is over,
  and if they all choose live, then they all die and, again, the game is over.

  The ST still needs to prompt the Al-Hadikhia for her picks because she could still mess up,
  by choosing dead players that then resurrect:
  a dead pick will say live and at least one of other picks will say die so the game continues because there are now still more than two alive.

  The Al-Hadikhia could get unlucky and end up in a final three with the Soldier and unprocced Fool ...

Q How can an Al-Hadikhia resurrect players?
A A dead player who chooses "Live" will come back to life, as long as one of the other picks says die.

Q An Al-Hadikhia and three other players are alive. The Al-Hadikhia picks two other players and themselves in the night, in that order.
  All three choices pick 'Live', therefore all will die. The players die in the order they were picked. After the first two players are killed,
  there are technically two players alive before the demon is killed.
  Does evil win right at that moment, or does this instance count as a tie, therefore giving good the win?
A Evil wins in this scenario:
  Evil wins when there are two players alive, and unless an ability says otherwise (such as the Mastermind or the Evil Twin),
  the game immediately ends and abilities do not finish resolving first.

Q Does the Monk stop a player from being chosen by the Al-Hakidia?
A No, they just do not die no matter what they choose.
  Note that if they choose die, and the other two choose live, the protected player does not die and causes everyone to die,
  of course, they are still protected, so the other two die.

Q Al-Hadikhia picks A B C
  A is alive picks Life
  B is dead picks Dead
  C is alive picks life
  Do A and C die?
A "After waking the third player and taking their choice, if all three players are alive, all three die."
  So A and C do not die.

Q If the Al-Hadikhia dies and the Scarlet Woman becomes a new Al-Hadikhia, could the new Al-Had resurrect the old Al-Had with their ability?
A Yes, then the ex-SW would become the SW again (hence the Al-Had and SW jinx to prevent two alive demons).

Q Why the Al-Hadikhia / Mastermind jinx?
A If the Al-Had is killed in a Mastermind game there would be no night announcement,
  meaning the good team would know the demon is dead and that it is a Mastermind day, making the Mastermind mechanically useless

Q Can a multi-kill per night demon attack the same player twice? e.g. the Shabaloth tries to eat the Fool twice with both kills, 
 or the Al-Hadikhia chooses the same player three time, thus ensuring they die ?
A No, it must be different players.

==========
=Amnesiac=
==========
Q What should the ST respond if the Amnesiac says "I would like to claim Amnesiac and start a cult" when their ability has nothing to do with that?
  Just say no? Let the cult run? Something else?
A ST choice.


============
=Apprentice=
============
Q How does the Apprentice work?
A She will get the ability of a Townsfolk (if good) or a Minion (if evil).

  Everyone will know that the player is a Traveller and that they are the Apprentice, but will not know her alignment or what ability she has,
  otherwise an evil Apprentice would just get instantly exiled.

==========
=Assassin=
==========
Q Can the Assassin kill the stormcaught Townsfolk?
A No.
  The Storm Catcher's ability and the Assassin ability are at odds with one another
  and while fabled characters do not inherently trump other characters,
  it is the intention that the Storm Catcher does trump the Assassin.

Q If the Assassin picks the alive Zombuul, does the game end?
A Yes.

Q Does the Assassin trump the Mayor?
A Yes, the Mayor just dies.  There can be no bounce, either to die instead of the Mayor or in addition to the Mayor.

Q Does the Fool die if targeted by the Assassin?
A Yes. The Fool ability counts as something that would prevent them from dying, so the Assassin ignores it and actually kills them. 

Q Can the Assassin kill the Lleech?
A Yes.

Q Does the Lycanthrope stop an Assassin kill?
A No.  The Assassin can still kill if the Lycanthrope hits a good player.

=========
=Atheist=
=========
Q Can puzzledrunking the Atheist mean evil roles can be included in the game?
A No. 

  The Atheist has a setup ability, the Puzzlemaster does not,
  so no one is puzzledrunk until after the tokens go out.

  The ST can make the Atheist _the_ Drunk or the Marionette,
  otherwise when the Atheist is in the bag there must be no evil characters.

Q If the Philosopher chooses the Atheist in a game that started with the Mastermind, and the ST then dies, could the ST "break the rules" making themself be considered the Demon?
A If the ST allowed the Philo-Atheist ability to remain in play, the ST can do whatever they want.

Q In an Atheist game the Alchemist has the Pit-Hag ability.
  If the Alchemist makes good a Demon that the town then executes, does the good team win or must the ST be executed?
A With the Atheist the ST can decide if the good team wins.

Q Who wins if the Atheist was drunk when the ST was executed?
A If the Atheist was drunk and there is no Demon in play then good would already have won.
  If there is a demon in play then evil would win.

  Although, if there is no evil team usually the ST will break the rules to keep the Atheist sober and not end the game by them being drunk.

Q Can there be an Atheist game without anyone being shown the Atheist token?
A Atheist "can" questions are almost certainly answerable with a "yes." Whether the ST should or not is debatable.
  So technically the ST can break the rules to do that, but probably should not.

Q Does the Engineer in an Atheist game create new evils or just not work?
A The Engineer can only change the characters of existing Demons and Minions (without breaking the rules). 
  In an Atheist game, the ST is reasonably likely to pretend that it has been effective, though, by changing what Demon/Minion abilities the town is hallucinating.

Q Does a nominated ST get a defense? 
  In a non Athiest game (with it on the script of course) could the ST use game state information in their defense?
  (e.g. they think claiming the nominating player is evil helps balance)
A If they want one, sure.
  They could say something funny like "ok” or "nooooo pleeeeaaaase I’m innoceeeeent”
  They would have to do that every time they were nominated to not give anything away though, probably too hard to balance and gives away too much info.
  "Go ahead, lose the game" is also an option.

Q Can the Philosopher choose Atheist?
A Yes. 
  Evil players are not removed from the game as that part of Atheist's ability is a setup ability, so it has no effect if entering play midgame.
  Good can now win the game be executing the ST.
  However, the ST can now do whatever they want, which typically will also include them uncreating the Atheist.

Q If Atheist is not on the script, can the Storyteller be executed?
A No. The ST can only be nominated at all when the Atheist is on the script. If it is not, then it is just not allowed to nom the ST.


============
=Balloonist=
============
Q Can the Balloonist learn name of a Traveller?
A No, unless they are holding Lil' Monsta or they are an Apprentice Spy.

Q How does droisoning work with the Balloonist?
  e.g. the Balloonist is droisoned N1,the ST points at a Minion and, in the grimoire, puts the Townsfolk reminder next to the Minion.
  If the Balloonist is no longer droisoned the next night, is the Townsfolk reminder still valid or does the Minion now count as a Minion? 
  i.e. does the ST choose something to "consume" at the time they point to a player or do they reevaluate each night?
A Once the Townsfolk reminder token is placed it is used, so the ST could show the same Minion again as a Minion if they wanted,
  but they could not show the sober Balloonist a Townsfolk anymore.

Q The Balloonist saw the Minion that the Imp starpassed to. Do they later see the same Minion again as the Demon?
A They can, or they can be shown the dead Imp.

Q In a base zero Outsider game, with both the Balloonist and the Vigormortis in play, is one a legal amount of Outsiders? 
  Or should it be net zero Outsiders?
  Is this ruling ST dependent?
A ST choice. One Outsider is legal.
  Most players prefer the net total method as the most intuitive choice.

Q What happens if the Balloonist dies and is resurrected (Professor / Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / ...) ?
A They are a fresh incarnation of the Balloonist
  so their reminder tokens are cleared and they would restart their info from scratch.

Q If a player gains an ability mid-game,
  does any of the setup up stuff, if there is any, happen? / 
  Does a Philosopher gaining the Balloonist ability, [+1 Outsider], turn a Townsfolk into an Outsider? /
  Does the Pit-Hag creating the Choirboy mid-game turn someone into the King?
A No, stuff inside of square brackets only happens during setup, which has already passed.

  Generally, when a player gains an ability mid-game:
  * "starts knowing x" -> the player gets this,
  * [x] -> this does not happen.

========
=Barber=
========
Q Is the Soldier safe when the Demon uses the Barber swap on them?
A No.

Q Could the Barber be swapped with a living player after they die and then the new Barber could get killed to trigger the swap again, repeatedly?
A Yes.

Q The Barber dies in a Legion game. The ST wakes one Legion and they swap themselves with another Legion. 
  Since neither player changed roles, does the ST tell the other Legion?
A The Demon cannot use the Barber to swap with a second Demon.

Q Can the former Scarlet Woman who is now the Demon, use the Barber to swap the previous Demon with a living player?
A No, the Barber's ability explicitly disallows choosing another Demon.

Q Why is "not another demon" clarified on the Barber's ability?
A If there is a dead Fang Gu, and that clause did not exist, a living Fang Gu could swap the dead Fang Gu with a Minion and get two living evil Fang Gus.
  This could also happen with the Pit-Hag creating multiple demons.

Q Can the current Demon kill the Barber and swap a dead Demon with a Minion, leading to two alive demons?  Can the ST kill on of them and have kills be arbitrary?
A Demons cannot choose other Demons with the Barber ability (it says so under the Barber's ability).
  The ST also cannot arbitrarily kill anyone with the Barber ability, only with the Pit-Hag ability when a new Demon is created.

Q Can a dead Demon (game continues due to ET) revive the Demon with a Barber swap?
A Yes. But only themselves, since it says "not another Demon"
  The extra Barber rule is to prevent two alive Demons.

Q If the Barber dies and no Demons are alive, who decides the swap? 
  Can a dead Demon move the demonhood back to a living player? 
A If no Demons are alive, then a dead Demon gets the swap. 
  They cannot swap another dead Demon into a living player,
  but they can swap their own demon ability back into play.

Q If the Barber dies in a game with no living Demons (Evil Twin in play, evil Demon executed) would the dead Demon still get to make the swap?
A Yes, "the Demon" may be a dead Demon if there are no alive Demons.

Q If a Farmer is Barber swapped with a Farmer does the ST have to tell the Farmers? 
A No, the rules say players always learn if their character changes and their character did not change.

Q Is the Barber able to swap a Traveller and a Townsfolk?
A The ST can allow it but generally no.

Q The Barber is killed. Can alignment be changed, say by the Demon swapping herself?
A Barber swaps do not change alignment, only character.

Q Can the Barber change the good twin, if the Demon swaps one of the twins? 
A If the Demon chooses to Barber swap the good twin player, then they are still the good twin, and the Evil Twin gets updated about what character they are now.
  If the Demon chooses to Barber swap the Evil Twin, then there will be a new ET pair who will get woken that night to learn each other.

Q If the dead Damsel gets swapped in to a living player from the Barber,
  is it random like it is for the Pit-Hag?
A No.

Q Does Barber swapping two players make new instances of these characters, refreshing their abilities?
A Yes.

=========
=Barista=
=========
Q Does Barista 1 have an effect on the Demon?
A Only if they would have otherwise been poisoned or drunk.

Q How does the Barista doubled Barber work?
A The Demon is woken to make a swap, goes to sleep, then immediately wakes again to make a second swap.
  If the Demon changes inbetween swaps, then it is the new Demon making the second swap.

Q What effect does Barista doubling the Fearmonger have?
A The Fearmonger can pick two players that night and nominating and executing either of them the following day will end the game.

  This could potentially result in two announcements of the Fearmonger selecting new players,
  so the Fearmonger will want to be careful in this situation not to reveal the Barista is evil and the Fearmonger has two selections that night.

Q Do roles that receive info only on N1 benefit from being selected by the Barista on later nights?
A Not a Barista 1 (sober + healthy + true), but a Barista 2 (ability works twice) could give them info again
  as their first night ability will work on a night other than the first.

Q Can the Drunk be chosen by the Barista?  How would that work?
A The Drunk can be chosen and, as well as being sober and healthy, would have to get true information if they think they are an info role.
  e.g. If the Drunk has the Empath token they would be informed of the correct number of neighbors who are evil

Q With Barista, can the ST choose that a character is sober and healthy, if they were already sober and healthy?
A Yes. That player would then be informed of the Barista choice so they would know for a fact they are sober and healthy, which is still pretty helpful,
  but not for start knowing roles where being sober and healthly now does not help them at all.

Q What does a Barista 1 Fortune Teller learn if she chooses her red herring?
A She would ignore their red herring.  Also she would not see the Recluse as the Demon.

Q If the Cannibal eats an evil player, and then by either the Barista or by an Amnesiac ability are somehow made sober,
  do they gain any ability?
A They gain the ability.
  A Barista'd Cannibal who eats the Spy is interesting.
  A Barista'd Cannibal who eats the Widow is completely hilarious.
  The ST should probably avoid giving a Barista bonus to the Cannibal.

Q How does the Barista work twice on the Savant?
A The Savant prompts the ST twice, and receives two sets of statements; one true and one false each.
  They do not receive two true statements and then two false.

Q Can the Barista let the Demon kill twice? 
A Yes.

Q What does a Barista 1 Savant learn?
A Two true statements.

Q When a once-per-use character is Barista 2'd,
  can they choose to use their ability once to use the extra use and keep their original use?
  e.g. Slayer, Artist, Damsel (!?), ...
A No.

Q What does a Barista 1 Drunk do?
A The Drunk must get true info.

Q What does a Barista 2 Damsel do?
A If the Damsel is Barista doubled when no guess has been made,
  two guesses can be made by the Minions today.
  If a guess has already been made,
  one more guess can be made today.
  However, as it would be the Damsel that would be told they were Barista doubled, 
  the Minions would not know they would get an extra opportunity to guess unless the Damsel announced it.

Q Does the Barista doubled Pit-Hag who uses their first pick to turn themselves into something else still get a second use of the Pit-Hag ability?
A No, as they no longer have the Pit-Hag ability.

Q Does the Barista doubled Pit-Hag who with her last pick turns herself into a role that acts after the Pit-Hag, get to use their new role twice too?
A Yes.

Q Does the Barista doubled Snake Charmer who hits the Demon get to make two kills as the Demon?
A Yes.

Q Does the Barista doubled Philosopher get to pick two abilities that night?
A Yes, but the Barista doubled Philosopher is completely broken so best not to do it.

========
=Beggar=
========
Q Does a living Beggar without a vote still count for purposes of majority voting? 
A Yes.

========
=Bishop=
========
Q How does the interaction between Judge and Bishop work?
  If the ST does not nominate a Bishop-opposed player first and the Judge ends it, then the day ends without the ST nominating an opposed player.
A The Judge's ability wins out in that case. The day just ends without the ST nominating an opposing player.
  The players can account for the fact that the Judge may have interrupted a day's worth of alignment information.

Q Can the ST call for the exile of a Traveller when the Bishop is in play?
A No.

================
=Bone Collector=
================
Q Can the Bone collector ability only be used once or every night?
A It is a once per game ability.

Q The Artist is dead. The Bone Collector targets the Artist at night. The Pukka poisons the Bone Collector later that same night. 
  The Artist tries to use their power the next day. Does it work?
A No; the BC is the only reason the Artist would be able to use their ability while dead and they are poisoned, so their ability is not functioning.

===========
=Boomdandy=
===========
Q After the Boomdandy is triggered can the Artist still ask the ST their question, in the post-execution minute?
A Yes, but this does not extend the time limit.

Q After the Boomdandy is triggered can the Fisherman  still get their advice within the post-execution minute?
A Yes, but this does not extend the time limit.

Q After the Boomdandy is triggered can the Savant still get their info within the post-execution minute?
A Yes, but this does not extend the time limit.

Q What if there is a tie in a Boomdandy vote?
A Noone dies, the game goes to night, and the Demon presumably kills.

Q If the Boomdandy explodes in a Lleech game, 
  the host must remain but does the Lleech need to remain alive as well?
A The Lleech host must be alive and the Lleech too since they can only die with their host.

Q Can the Pacifist block deaths caused by the Boomdandy being executed?
A No. The Pacifist saves good players specifically from execution, and Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q If the Saint is killed when the Boomdandy explodes, is that an evil win?
A No. The Saint needs to die to execution for evil to win, and Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q Is a player protected by the Devil's Advocate safe from dying when the Boomdandy explodes?
A No. The DA protects players from execution, and Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q If the Goblin player publically claims Goblin and dies when the Boomdandy explodes, is that an evil win?
A No. The Goblin needs to be executed, and Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q If the Boomdandy explodes in a Leviathan game, do the deaths count towards the Leviathan's execution count?
A No, as Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q If the Boomdandy explodes, is it okay to kill the Demon and have the game continue into a Mastermind day?
A No that would be an evil loss.  In order to trigger a Mastermind day the Demon must be executed, and Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q Can the Demon die when the Boomdandy goes off and the Scarlet Woman is in play?
A Yes, that is legal, as long as there are five players alive when the Demon dies. The SW will reason that they are now the Demon.

Q If the Boomdandy is executed on final three, does the Boomdandy's ability still trigger and all players point to either of the last two players alive?
A No. Two players alive is the evil team's win condition, so the game ends and evil wins.

Q Who should the ST kill when the Boomdandy triggers?
A It is going to be very specific to the exact characters in play and alive.
  Some general guidelines and ideas:
  * In most cases, leave the Demon alive in the final three, otherwise the game ends in good’s favour using a Minion ability.
  * The Demon can be killed if there is an Evil Twin pair both still alive, leaving the choice for town to choose between the two twins with a non-Demon third player.
  * The final three cannot be the twins and the Demon as that is an automatic Demon win.
  * It is a bad idea to leave hard-confirmed characters alive in final three.
    A final three that includes the proc'd Virgin and the Professor who resurrected a dead player would be unfair on evil who managed to get their Boomdandy executed.
  * If the Klutz killed by the Boomdandy chose a player between executions, the Klutz-picked player can be left alive to cast suspicion on the Klutz claim.
  * There is no mechanical problem to leave only evil left alive in final three as the Boomdandy kill does not require a nomination,
    just the pointing, but this can be very hard on good to have to work out exactly which of the evil players is actually the Demon.
  * There are some abilities that can prevent the Boomdandy coming down to a final three and instead having four or even five left alive. 
    While this can be interesting, it should be used sparingly, as it soft-confirms a few players
    (the player claiming Sailor or Fool is almost certainly good / the Tea Lady and their neighbours / ... ). 

===============
=Bounty Hunter=
===============
Q Can the Spy register as a good Townsfolk in order to be turned evil by the Bounty Hunter?
A Yes, but this is not recommended.

Q Does the Bounty Hunter who learns the Zombuul still learn a different player after the Zombuul 'dies' for the first time?
A Yes.

Q If the Bounty Hunter’s evil Townsfolk is turned into an Outsider, are they still evil or do they become good and a new Townsfolk made evil?
A They remain evil, as they were turned on setup and their alignment being evil is not an ongoing effect and not linked to their character.

Q Does the Bounty Hunter sitting next to the No Dashii still turn a Townsfolk evil? 
A Yes, because it is a setup effect.

Q Can the Bounty Hunter learn the currently evil Cult Leader?
A The Bounty Hunter can learn any evil player, so yes,
  and the BH will only learn a new player when the Cult Leader dies regardless of any subsequent alignment change. 

Q Can the Bounty Hunter learn the Recluse?
A Yes.

Q Are the Minions and the Demon informed of the Townsfolk turned evil by the Bounty Hunter?
A No.

Q Can the Bounty Hunter be the evil Townsfolk?
A Yes, but this is not recommended.

Q Can the Bounty Hunter learn a Vigor-killed Minion?
A Yes, it is possible for them to learn any dead evil player.
  The only restriction is that they cannot learn the same player twice in a row.
  The ST will need to consider if this is a fair move,
  since the BH only gets a new name when their current target dies, and the dead cannot die (unless they are first resurrected somehow),
  so showing them a dead evil player probably means that they will get no more info for the rest of the game.

Q If the Bounty Hunter dies and then is resurrected (Professor / Al-Hadikhia / ...) do they learn a new evil player?
A Yes, which can be the same previously learnt player or a new evil player.

Q If an evil player the Bounty Hunter see dies, a new evil player is shown.
  But if a previously seen evil player is resurrected (Al-Hadikhia) and dies again, does the BH learn another evil player?
A No.

  For example:
  * the BH sees the Godfather on N1
  * the Godfather is executed on D1
  * the BH sees the Mezepheles on N2 and the Godfather is resurrected by the Al-Hadikhia
  * the Godfather is executed again D2
  * N3 the BH does not get a new name, as their current known evil player is still the Mezepheles

Q If a player gains the Bounty Hunter ability (Apprentice / Cannibal / Huntsman turned Damsel / Philosopher / Pit-Hag / Pixie / ...) mid game,
  is a Townsfolk turned evil?
A No, [1 Townsfolk is evil] is only part of the setup.

  However, should the Apprentice join the town before the game begins and is there from the start of the first night,
  their [setup] effect would take place (the ST should judge the evil:good ratio carefully).
  
  Some STs rule that the Philosopher selecting the BH ability _does_ turn a Townsfolk evil,
  otherwise they are learning an evil player without the downside of turning a good player evil which is rather powerful.



========
=Butler=
========
Q If the Butler does not follow their chosen master while voting, what happens?
A Mechanically, nothing.
  The ST counts their vote as otherwise they are hard confirmed, which removes all of the downside that should come with being an Outsider.
  However, the ST should privately tell them to pay better attention in the future.
  If it turns out they are doing it intentionally, then they are just cheating.
  Sometimes Butler players claim that they are testing for droisoning but this is still cheating.

Q How does the ST ensure the Butler ability is respected without outing the Butler? / If the Butler does not follow their chosen master while voting, what happens?
A If the Butler votes illegally, tally the Butler's vote anyway.
  Otherwise the total will be less than it should be, hard confirming the Butler, which is unfair for the evil team.
  Mistakes happen, just play on.

  Later, the ST should speak with them privately and remind them of the constraints of their ability,
  and let them know that it is considered cheating to purposefully vote without their master.
  Generally this is enough to keep a player paying more attention, because most people are not playing this game in bad faith nor looking to cheat.

  If they keep doing it though, then deal with it however the group would like to deal with cheating.
  Ending the game early, letting it finish but talking about it after, not inviting that person back, etc.
  There is no prescriptive option for what to do with someone who is cheating, as that is a social issue for the group to handle.

==========
=Cannibal=
==========
Q If the Cannibal eats the Alchemist and is shown the Scarlet Woman,
  do they become the good Demon when the Demon is executed the next day,
  or are they the poisoned Cannibal?
A They become the good Demon; the SW ability triggers before the Cannibal can switch abilities.

Q If the Cannibal eats a role that gained another ability (Pixie / Philosopher)
  does she see both roles?
A No, the Cannibal just eats the original role.
  
  The Cannibal does not care what else someone might have gained, just what their token is.

Q What is the Butler jinx with the Cannibal?
A If the Cannibal gains the Butler ability, the Cannibal learns this, otherwise they could break the Butler rules regarding voting without realising.

Q If the Cannibal eats the Spy who registers as a good Townsfolk with a mechanical ability, such as the  Monk or the Gossip), what would happen?
A The Cannibal has that ability so long as the Spy continues to register as good.

Q Can the Cannibal change alignment after eating and gaining the ability of the Goon or the Cult Leader?
A Yes, and if another non-alignment changing player is executed before they change back again, the Cannibal can be locked in as their changed alignment.

Q If the Cannibal is picked by a character checking ability (Dreamer / Gambler / Grandmother / Ravenkeeper / Undertaker / ...) what are they seen as?
A The Cannibal, regardless of the ability they may have gained.

Q The Cannibal gains the ability of the recently killed executee.  What happens if that character is resurrected (Professor / Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / ...)?
A The Cannibal keeps their ability, because they are still the recently killed executee even though they are alive again.
  
Q Does the Cannibal who is resurrected (Professor / Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / ...) still gain the ability of the recently killed executee that night?
A Yes, they immediately gain the relevant ability.

  For example, the Chambermaid is executed and dies, 
  then the Professor resurrects the Cannibal that night, 
  the Cannibal will wake the same night to use the Chambermaid ability,
  even though the Cannibal was dead when the Chambermaid was executed.

Q If the Alchemist gains a new ability due to a Hatter, are they informed of the new ability they have,
  or do they have to figure it out like the Cannibal?
A The ST wakes them at night to tell them about their new ability.

Q If an evil Townsfolk or Outsider (Bounty Hunter turned / Mezepheles turned / Cult Leader sat next to an evil player / flipped Goon) is executed, is the Cannibal poisoned?
A Yes, the Cannibal is poisoned by any evil role.

Q How does a a mid game created Juggler (Philosopher / Cannibal / Damsel / Barber /Pit-Hag / ...) work?
A They would juggle the day after they become the Juggler and learn their info the following night.

Q How is the Cannibal Juggler ever going to get their info?
A In the case of the Cannibal Juggler, there would have to be no new deaths by execution the day they juggled,
  so that they maintain their Juggler ability to find out the results of their juggle the following night.
  Perhaps town could kindly execute a dead or protected player, instead of someone who is going to die ...

Q The Spy is executed. Tonight, can the Cannibal cause a player to learn that the Cannibal is the Nightwatchman?
A Yes. If the Spy is executed, they may register as any good character and cause the Cannibal to gain any good ability.

Q If the Cannibal gains the Alchemist ability, are they told what Minion ability they have?
A Yes, and that ability does not need to be the original Alchemist's ability, as long as it is also a not in-play Minion ability.

-----------------combine
Q If the Barista picks the Cannibal after an evil player was executed, can the Cannibal potentially become a good Demon?
A The Cannibal would have the sober and healthy ability of the evil player. They do not become that role, just gain the ability of.

Q What happens if the poisoned Cannibal (an evil was executed) gets Barista'd for true info?
A Then they are not poisoned, and gain the ability of the player who was executed (even if that is a Minion ability). 
  Sometimes best not done if, for example, the Widow was just executed.
---------------------------

Q If a good Demon is executed and there are no other Demons alive, but the Cannibal is in play,
  does the game immediately end or does it continue until the Cannibal no longer has the Demon's ability? 
A The Cannibal with a Demon ability still is not a Demon, so with no Demon alive, the game would end.

Q What happens when the Cannibal eats the Drunk?
A They gain the ability of the Drunk, so the ST deceives the Cannibal that they have any Townsfolk ability, usually whatever the Drunk thought that they had.

  Regardless of what ability the ST pretends they have gained,
  if it is mechanical it cannot have an effect on the game;
  if it is informational, the information is arbitrary.

Q After eating the Drunk, if somoene else dies, does the Cannibal get to eat them or do they stay 'the Drunk'?
A The Cannibal gets to eat them.
  They have the ability of the Drunk, but they are not actually the Drunk so their main Cannibal ability works just fine. 

Q If the Huntsman guesses the Cannibal Damsel as the Damsel, what happens?
A Nothing. The Huntsman cannot successfully select the Cannibal Damsel, because the Cannibal is not the Damsel.

Q If the Cannibal eats the Damsel, do the Minions get a fresh Damsel ping?
A No, they already knew the Damsel was in play so they are not informed again.
  The announcement is once per game no matter how many instances of the Damsel or their ability are created.
  But, as this is a new instance of the ability, the Minions do get a fresh guess.

Q What happens if, after the Cannibal eats the Damsel, a Minion guesses the Cannibal as the Damsel?
A Evil wins.

Q If a player who is scheduled to be Mezepheles turned is executed that day, is the Cannibal still poisoned?
A The Mez can turn a dead player and the Cannibal is a constant check,
  so the Cannibal would become poisoned as soon as the recently executed player turns evil. 

Q If the Cannibal gains the Pixie ability, and the other player dies, does the Cannibal keep the ability after Cannibal swapping?
A When a new player dies from execution, the Cannibal loses the Pixie ability, 
  and in turn loses any other ability they might have gained (although it is very difficult in the first place
  for the Cannibal to gain an ability via the Pixie ability)

Q If a player gains the Nightwatchman ability (Philosopher / Cannibal / Pixie ) what are they shown to other players as?
A Nightwatchman.
  It is the Nightwatchman ability, so their target is shown the Nightwatchman token, not the token of the player with the ability.
  
  "Learn who you are" roughly translates into "A player knows they have been effected by an ability and who holds that ability".

Q The Cannibal wants to ask their Artist question / get their Savant info, but the player that died was good but not actually the Artist/Savant.
  What does the ST answer to the Cannibal-Artist/ Cannibal-Savant question? 
A The ST could reply with something like "I cannot answer that" / "You cannot do that", 
  just as they would to any non-Artist/non-Savant who tries to use a question / get info.

Q The Cannibal Preacher hits a minion. The next day, another player is executed and the Cannibal no longer has  the Preacher ability.
  Does the Minion wake and use their ability as normal?
A Yes, the Preacher ability that hampers the Minion is no longer in play.

Q If the Cannibal who was nominated earlier in the game gains the Virgin ability,
  do they cause a Townsfolk who nominates them to be immediately executed?
A Yes, it is a new instance of the ability and the player has not been nominated since getting it, so if a Townsfolk noms them they'll be executed.

Q Does the Cannibal with the Savant ability get any hint from the ST that she can get two pieces of information?
A No it is the Cannibal's job to find out what ability she might have by talking to executed players.

Q If the Mutant is executed, could the Cannibal be executed if for some reason they claim that they are an Outsider?
A Yes.

  They can claim to be the Cannibal with the Mutant ability,
  because that is not claiming an Outsider, that is claiming to be the Cannibal (who is a Townsfolk),
  but they are at risk of execution for any Outsider claims. 

Q Does the Demon learn the Cannibal after the Lunatic is executed?
A Yes.  The Cannibal would have the all of the Lunatic's ability, which means the Demon must know that player as their Lunatic, and their choices.

Q What happens when the Cannibal eats the Lunatic?
A The Cannibal is told that they are one of the Demons on the script.
  Some STs will confirm that they are still good, but RAW this is unnecessary.
  The ST takes the Cannibal's kill choices and informs the actual Demon that the Cannibal player is their Lunatic and who they chose.
  The Demon will then immediately know who the Cannibal is.

  If the Cannibal asks what character they are at any point while they have the Lunatic ability,
  they should be told that they are the Demon that they were shown.

  If they lose the Lunatic ability through a further execution,
  then they are treated exactly as they would have been had that execution occurred without a Lunatic execution beforehand.
  They are not told about no longer being a Demon but if they ask what character they are, they should be told that they are the Cannibal, 
  with nothing confirmed about why they were told that they were a Demon.

  All of this assumes that the Cannibal is not droisoned.  If they ate an evil player then they can be lied to about their ability.
  And on a script with the Pit-Hag or the Fang Gu and the Drunk, it is possible for the Cannibal to believe that they really are the Demon.

Q The Cannibal eats the Philosopher, then picks Cannibal so they become drunk.
  Does the drunkenness get removed because they are what drunks themselves?
A Droison loops are resolved by the involved players being droisoned.
  So the Cannibal drunks herself until another player dies by execution.

Q Riot and Cannibal. It states that nominated deaths count as executions for the Cannibal. 
  Does that mean that the Cannibal can potentially have multiple abilities functioning that night 
  and they do not know which ones are being used each time they wake up to use them?
A The Cannibal's ability is still the most recently killed executee, so they only have the one ability at a time, though it may change rapidly as players nominate one another.

Q If the Cannibal eats the Snitch, do Minions gain another three bluffs or do they get nothing?
A They get another three, since there is a new Snitch ability in play.

----------------contradictory?
Q Could the Spy register as good therefore letting the Cannibal see the Grimoire?
A Yes.

P Cannibal with the Spy
I The Cannibal cannot legitimately be treated as sober/healthy and having gained the Spy ability without having a legitimately good Spy already.
  The Spy specifically registers as good and as a Townsfolk or Outsider,
  so if the Spy registers as good to the Cannibal, they must also register as a specific Townsfolk/Outsider and the Cannibal would gain that ability instead.

  Still, if the Spy registers as evil, the Cannibal is poisoned and can technically be deceived about anything, 
  including seeing an accurate grimoire!
------------------

Q Could the Cannibal gain a random ability after the Spy dies?
A Yes, the Cannibal could get any good ability,
  though most of the time it is going to make more sense to register the Spy as evil to poison the Cannibal and then making up whatever is relevant.

Q What happens when the Cannibal eats the Recluse?
A The ST has several options:
  * The Recluse registers as a Demon: the Cannibal gains a demon ability! Do not do this.
  * The Recluse registers as evil: the Cannibal is poisoned so the ST can pretend that they have any ability.
  * The Recluse registers as the Recluse: the Cannibal gains the Recluse ability and can register as evil or as a Minion or the Demon to other abilities.

Q If the Cannibal eats the Slayer do they learn they have a shot?
A No, as with the Artist or any other ability that does not wake at night.

Q If the Cannibal eats a Grandmother, does he get his info first, or only after the Demon's choice?
A After they have had the chance to be drunk, poisoned, and killed.

Q If the Scapegoat, a Traveller, is executed, can the Cannibal gain their ability? 
A Yes. 
  Travellers can get executed due to their ability (the Scapegoat) or madness breaks.
  And if a Traveller instead of being exiled is executed
  then the Cannibal get's that (good) Traveller's ability.
  Unless they were an evil Traveller, in which case the Cannibal is poisoned.

Q If the Cannibal gets the Goon’s ability and then gets selected by an evil player turning them evil,
  then the next day a new player is executed and they get that power, do they stay evil?
A Yes.
  Interactions with the likes of the Goon and the Cult Leader can make evil Cannibals, 
  but does require that the executed role not be evil at the time of their execution,
  else the Cannibal would be poisoned.

  The possibility of too many evils getting created is why the Spirit of Ivory exists.


===========
=Cerenovus=
===========
Q If a player is made Cerenovous mad as the role that they actually have, 
  can they claim this,
  and be safe from a madness break execution?
A Often it does lead to execution because of its use as code for "I am not actually this role".

  But claiming to be Cerenovus mad as your role is fine if the player is making a sincere effort to convince other players that that is what happened; this is fulfilling madness.

Q A good player is Cerenovus mad and breaks madness. The ST decides to not execute for the madness break. 
  The next day the good player is no longer Cerenovous mad.
  Can the ST on any subsequent day execute the good player for the previous madness break?
A The madness due to the Cerenovus ability is in effect until the end of the following night,
  so once that time has passed, their target cannot be executed for breaking madness because it no longer applies to them.
  
  This does mean that after the Cerenovus picks a new madness target, 
  the previous player could still be executed for breaking madness before the end of the night phase,
  but most STs would not do this as night executions usually make little sense.

Q Can the Cerenovus target a Traveller?
A Yes.

  And while Travellers cannot be nominated for execution, the ST can be execute them for breaking madness.

Q Can the self mad Cerenovus be executed?
A Yes, but it is probably best not to if it is final three so as not be too harmful to the good team.

Q Can the Cerenovus mad player claim to be the Philosopher turned into a good role, or does the play need to directly claim the good role?
A The player must try to convince people that they are that role, not that they just have that ability.
  Otherwise, they can be executed for a madness break.
  It is up to the ST if they want to execute for breaking madness it that way, since it can be viewed as a more minor break, but it is still going against madness.
  
Q Can the Cerenovus (or somethimg similar) cause a Traveller to be executed?
A Yes.

Q If a player is Cerenovus mad, dies, and then breaks madness in death, can they be executed?
A Yes.

Q If someone is Cerenovus'd as the Butler, but votes when their claim-to-be master does not, can the voting be cut off and she be executed immediately?
A If the ST thinks that she is not being mad as the Butler, she may be executed.
  It could happen immediately though it is almost certainly better to at least way until the vote is finished.

Q Suppose the Cerenovus maddens a dead player, to either maintain confusion or waste an execution.
  Someone else is executed; is it allowed for the mad player to break madness immediately after the announcement?
  Technically they will remain mad until the Cere's night order, but there is no longer a downside in breaking it.
  Is it cheating (so the ST could punish it by executing them tomorrow anyway),
  or maybe maddening a dead player is strong and can be taken down a notch, or maybe Cere can counterplay by maddening them again?
A Executions can occur at night and it is a legal way to punish good sometimes.
  But as they are already dead, this will cause them to simply die, or well, nothing will happen 
  As ST it might be best to not execute them to confirm nothing

Q Is a player claiming there is a Cerenovus while they are mad (but still pretending to be the character that they are supposed to be mad about) breaking madness?
A Not inherently, but madness is really subjective and context dependent.

Q The Slayer while Cerenovus mad claims Slayer.  Can she be executed before she shoots due to breaking madness?
A Yes.


=============
=Chambermaid=
=============
Q What is the Al-Hadikhia jinx with the Chambermaid?
A The Al-Hadikhia's targets do not register as waking, if they would not otherwise wake,
  because it is due to the Al-Hadikhia ability that they are waking.

Q Do "start knowing" roles, like the Grandmother learning their grandchild, register on their first night to the Chambermaid?
A Yes, they woke up to their own ability.

Q Does waking a Minion to tell them the Damsel is in play register to the Chambermaid?
A No, that is not waking due to their ability.

Q If the Chambermaid chooses someone who died that same night, are they told to choose another player?
A Yes.  That will reveal to the Chambermaid one of their picks died,
  but the death is declared in the morning before anyone else should be talking so it does not matter.

Q If the good Mezepheles turns themselves evil that night, does that count as a +1 to the Chambermaid?
A Yes, they woke up due to their own ability.

Q The Snake Charmer picks the Demon. The Chambermaid checks the new Demon, who did not wake as a part of the Demon's ability, but as a part of the Snake Charmer's ability.
  Is that a +1 to the Chambermaid?
A Yes.
  They were at one point in the night the Snake Charmer who woke as the Snake Charmer,
  which counts as waking to your own ability,
  so it is a Chambermaid +1.

Q If the Demon is selected by the Exorcist, their waking to learn the Exorcist is not reflected in the Chambermaid's number,
  since they are waking due to the Exorcist's ability.
  However, if the Recluse registering as the Demon is selected by the Exorcist, 
  then them waking to see the Exorcist is caused by the Exorcist's ability or their own,
  since it was their own mis-registration that allowed them to wake?
A They woke to the Exorcist’s ability so it does not register to the Chambermaid.
  They are not being tricked into believing something fake (like the Lunatic for instance), so it is not their own ability.
  The Exorcist still did choose them and directly cause their waking.

Q If someone wakes and chooses not to use their ability (Professor / Philosopher / Courtier / ...) does it register to the Chambermaid?
A Yes, they still woke to their own ability.
  If a player has a once-per-game ability,
  they wake up each night for their own ability so that they can choose to use it or not.
  Once it is used, they stop waking up.

  Under Tips and Tricks for the Chambermaid:
  "Pick players to verify their claims.
  If someone is claiming to be the Gambler, they will wake up every night - check them and see if they are being honest.
  As another example, someone claiming to be a Courtier will only wake up each night until they have used their ability
  - if they are claiming to have used their ability,
  you can check to see if that is true by seeing if they wake up the next night!"

Q Who can the Chambermaid pick if they are alive in a final two, where the Zombuul is registering as dead?
  The Chambermaid must pick two alive players but cannot pick themselves and there is only one other alive player.
A They do not get any info.
  There is no need to even wake them.

Q Does a Minion learning they are now the Imp alert the Chambermaid?
A No. They are not waking to their own ability.

  Telling a player their character has changed is not an ability's action, it is game mechanics.

Q Does a Minion / the Demon waking up to learn their new role after an Engineer swap ping the Chambermaid?
A Only if they wake due to their new ability.

Q Does a new instance of the Evil Twin learning their twin ping the Chambermaid?
A Yes.  Learning that they are now the Evil Twin does not ping the Chambermaid,
  but waking due to their ability to know their twin is a Chambermaid +1.

Q Does any character waking to learn of a change in alignment count for the Chambermaid, or just the Goon and the Cult Leader?
A The Chambermaid only learns if the character woke due to their own power. So a Mezepheles turning someone, for example, does not count for the Chambermaid.

Q Does the Goon waking to learn she switched alignment register to the Chambermaid?
  And if the Goon is already the same alignment as what she would have changed to, does it count for the Chambermaid?
A If the Goon wakes to learn their alignment changed due to her ability,
  then this registers to the Chambermaid.
  If she did not change alignment because the first person to pick her has the same alignment,
  then she would not have woken so no registering to the Chambermaid.
  If the Goon changes alignment through other means than their ability, such as Mezepheles,
  then this waking does not register to the Chambermaid.

Q Can the Chambermaid ping falsely off of the Spy?
A No, the Spy misregistering as a different character does not change whether or not they woke up.

Q If the Scarlet Woman does not get turned into the Imp, do they wake up for Chambermaid's ability?
  Or do they only wake up if they are turned into the Imp?
A They would only wake for the Chambermaid when they become the Imp.
  Do they wake for the Chambermaid if the Imp self kills? If you argue that the SW becomes the Imp due to the Imp’s ability, then no
  since changing characters is not an ability.

Q The Drunk/Marionette thinks they are a Townsfolk, and wakes up to falsely to learn that they are the Farmer.  Does this ping the Chambermaid?
A Yes, as the waking is due to their own ability.

Q Does the Drunk/Marionette who thinks they are the Fortune Teller "wake at night due to their own ability" for the Chambermaid?
A Yes.

Q The Lunatic thinks they are a Legion, and wakes up to falsely learn a player is the Exorcist that selected them. Does this ping the Chambermaid?
A Yes, as the waking is due to their own ability.

Q Does Minion info Or Demon info count as waking up to the Chambermaid?
A No, the Chambermaid detects if a player woke up for their character ability, and Minion and Demon Info are a function of character type, not character ability.
  In contrast, a Lunatic, who wakes up to receive Demon Info is detected by the Chambermaid
  because they are not actually a Demon and did wake up due to their own ability.

======
=Chef=
======
Q With the seating of Imp-Recluse-Poisoner-Baron, what could you show the Chef?
A The Chef number could be any of 1, 2, or 3 with this seating, as the Recluse can register as good and evil for separate instances of the Chef ability.

==========
=Choirboy=
==========
Q What does the Choirboy see in a Legion game?
A Any of the living Legion players.

Q Could the Choirboy be shown the Recluse after the King is killed by the Demon?
A Yes, though that is unlikely to be a fair move,
  especially if the Choirboy’s convincingly bluffed something else so the Demon does not think the Choirboy is in play.

Q Can the King be the Drunk or the Marionette if the Choirboy is in play?
A No, that would be an illegal setup.

  If the player who thinks they are the King is actually the Drunk or the Marionette,
  then the King is not in play and the [setup brackets] of the Choirboy ability has not been satisfied.
  
  To avoid situations where the Demon is sat between a Minion and the King, leaving no valid Marionette, 
  the ST should use an alternative setup.
  
Q Can the Choirboy be the Drunk or the Marionette if the King is in play?
A Yes, this is a legitimate setup, 
  where the King has not been forced into play by the Choirboy, they are there by their own right.

Q You cannot have the Choirboy and the Drunk/Marionette King, but could you have the King turned evil by the Bounty Hunter?
A Yes.

Q In a two Minion game on a script with the Marionette, the King, and the Choirboy, while roles are randomly assigned,
  the Demon ends up neighboring one minion and the King, who must become the Marionette, but the Choirboy is still in play.
  An illegal setup!  How can this be avoided?  Remove the King from the bag and put it back later as you do in a three Minion game?
A The better move is to not have the Demon in the bag. 
  Switching someone's token to the King would let a good player know a not in play role.

Q If the King is killed then resurrected (Professor / Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / ...) then dies again, does the Choirboy get their info each time?
A The Choirboy learns the Demon each time the King is killed by the Demon.

Q If the King is Barber swapped with a dead player, does the Choirboy get their info?
A No, the King was not killed by the Demon.

Q If the King is killed by a non Demon (Gossip / Lycanthrope / Virgin / Moonchild / Assassin / Cerenovus / Godfather / Pit-Hag / Witch / Apprentice / Butcher / Gunslinger / Harlot / Judge / ...),
  does the Choirboy learn the Demon?
A No, except if the player that kills the King is holding Lil’ Monsta at the time and so registers as the Demon.

Q The Demon kill bounces off the Mayor to the King.  Does the Choirboy get their info?
A Yes.  A bounce off the Mayor is treated as full redirection of the entire ability,
  so it is as if the Demon directly chose the King.

Q Who does the Choirboy learn if the Vortox kills the King?
A Any non-Demon player.


============
=Clockmaker=
============
Q Can the Clockmaker learn a zero?
A If the Clockmaker sees either no Demons or no Minions, the ST simply shakes their head to indicate there is no valid information to give and puts her back to sleep.
  The only way for the Clockmaker to learn a zero is if they are poisoned, drunk, or Vortox’d,
  but it would be an immediate giveaway that they are one of those things due to it normally being impossible.
  Outside of SnV, a one minion game with the Spy can give the Clockmaker a no.

Q What is the interaction between the Recluse and the Clockmaker?
A The Recluse can register as a Minion or a Demon to make a smaller Clockmaker number than there should be,
  but if a Minion and a Demon were sat right next to each other the ST could not use the Recluse to give a larger number to the Clockmaker.

Q If the Clockmaker is created midgame (Philo-Clockmaker, pithagging, Barber swap), do dead players count as spaces?
A Yes.

Q Does the Clockmaker count Travellers when calculating steps?
A Yes, as the Clockmaker counts "the number of seated players".

==========
=Courtier=
==========
Q What happens if the Courtier drunked player changes character?
A They stay Courtier drunk as once it has happened, the drunkedness is tied to the player.

---------------combine
Q The Courtier drunks the Demon who dies and the Scarlet Woman becomes the new Demon.  Is the new Demon still drunked by the Courtier (assuming less than three days have passed)?
A No, the Courtier drunkenness does not migrate; it stays on the targeted player.

Q If the Demon is Courtier drunk and then dies and swaps to the Scarlet Woman, is the SW (new Demon) also drunk?
A No. The player with that character at that time is the one that is made drunk. Courtier essentially uses the character to choose the player.
---------------------

Q What is the interaction between the Courtier and the Lunatic?
A The Lunatic is still deceived that they are the Demon, but the actual Demon does not learn the Lunatic's choices.

Q If the Courtier drunks Legion, do they drunk all the Legion players or does the ST choose only one? 
A Just one. If there are multiple copies of a character in play and the Courtier chooses that character, the Storyteller chooses one of those players to make drunk.

Q What happens when a Courtier is droisoned while their ability is active? Does the day still tick by, or is their ability effectively paused while droisoned?
A If the Courtier was sober/healthy when they used their ability, then their token is placed down. 
  If they become drunk/poisoned then, while they are droisoned, their target is no longer Courtier-drunk.
  If they become health/sober again before the three days run out, the target is once again drunk.
  While the Courtier is droisoned, the timer continues to count down,
  so if the timer runs out before they become sober/healthy again, the target is simply not going to be re-drunked by the Courtier.

Q The Courtier drunks the Goblin, but there is no Goblin in play. Later the Pit-Hag creates the Goblin. Will the Goblin be drunked?
A No. The Courtier's drunkenness is applied, or not, to a player at the time of the choice, and will not change after the fact even if characters are changed.

Q If the Courtier dies before the three days are over, does the drunkness end?
A Yes, unless otherwise stated, players lose their ability on death, so any drunkenness caused by the Courtier ends when she dies.

Q If the Demon was Courtier drunk, and she had already made a choice, and then the Courtier dies by a Gossip that night, does a Demon kill go through?
A No.
  The Demon was drunk at the time their ability would have fired,
  the malfunction means no reminder token would have been placed, 
  so at no point was anyone marked to die.

Q The Courtier drunks the Leviathan and for three days players execute good players with no fear.
  What happens when the Leviathan becomes sober? Evil team wins?
A Assuming the Courtier remains sober, healthy and alive then:
  If N1 the Courtier hits the Leviathan (at which point, town actually do not know it is a Leviathan game, because making the Leviathan drunk suppresses the announcement).
  then only on day 4 is the announcement made, and the Leviathan has seen nothing,
  meaning the good team has two chances left to hit the Leviathan, 
  or loses because of time (since it will be the end of Day 5 after the second execution).
  If N2 the Leviathan is drunked,
  then she will need to be executed on day 5 or good will lose on time/executions.
  If the Leviathan is drunked any later point than that,
  then good loses as soon as the Levi is sober. 

Q Can the Courtier drunk fabled characters?
A No.

  The Courtier drunks players with the character that they pick, 
  and as no player can be assigned a fabled character, only those listed on the character sheet,
  the Courtier is unable to drunk a fabled character.

Q If the Cannibal Courtier chooses the Demon, but then a non-Courtier is executed, will the Demon become sober?
A Yes.


=============
=Cult Leader=
=============
Q By dawn, the sober, healthy Cult Leader, Imp, and Baron are alive. Mechanically, must the game be over?
A The Cult Leader does not know who the demon is for sure and could possibly still accidentally nominate the demon and lose.

Q How does the Mezepheles turned Cult Leader work?
A If the Cult Leader is evil and is the first to say the Mez word, nothing happens.
  If the Cult Leader is good and is the first to say the Mez word, she turns evil that night.
  The Cult Leader still has her own ability, so may turn good or evil according to her neighbors.
  Interestingly the the Cult Leader acts after the Mez in the night order.

Q If the Cult Leader changes their alignment, do they learn that immediately that night?
A Yes.

Q If the Cult Leader is turned evil by the Mezepheles, can they later turn good again?
A Yes.

Q If the Cult Leader is droisoned, they can never swap alignment until sober (except the Mez), but can the ST trick them that they changed alignment when they had not?
A Yes but don't.

  It is recommended against in the rulebook.
  The ST can but should exercise caution, erring on the side of not unless they are quite sure that player/group would enjoy that kind of thing.

Q In order to correctly guess the Philosopher-Damsel or the Cannibal-Damsel, what does a Minion have to say? "X is the Philo/Cannibal" or "X is the Damsel" or either?
A A Minion must guess "X is the Damsel".

  "You" in abilities is self-referential to the ability.

========
=Damsel=
========
Q If the Damsel is drunk (Puzzlemaster / Courtier / Sailor / ...) do the Minion not get informed?
A Puzzlemaster drunking would prevent the Minions learning the Damsel, as the Damsel comes into play already drunk; it is a setup effect.
  Other sources of drunkening act after the Minion info step in the night order so cannot prevent the Minions learning the Damsel.
  
  With that understood, using the Puzzlemaster to drunk the Damsel is not recommended. 

Q What stops players from insisting that everyone publicly guesses themselves as the Damsel to prove that they are not a Minion to to waste the Damsel guess?
A The ST is advised to ignore any forced statements.

Q Does each Minion get an individual Damsel guess or collectively one guess?
A Collectively one guess.

Q In a base two Outsiders game with the Huntsman, and no other Outsider manipulation, how many Outsiders comprise a legal setup?
A Two or three:
  * two if the Damsel is one of the regular base two Outsiders
  * three if the Damsel replaces a Townsfolk, i.e. adding the Damsel with the Huntsman on top of the normal Outsider count.
  
  Most players prefer it if the Damsel replaces one of the regular Outsiders rather than a Townsfolk for fun and balance purposes.

Q Can the evil Apprentice guess the Damsel.
A No, they may have a Minion ability, but they are not a Minion.

Q What happens if the Damsel is resurrected?
A The Minions are not reinformed about the Damsel, as it is a once per game announcement.
  However, if there is a new Minion who has not previously been informed they would be informed,
  in which case it is best to not resurrect the Damsel using the Shabaloth.
 
  If guesses have been made previous to the Damsel resurrection,
  they do not count for this new instance of the Damsel ability,
  so the Minions have one more opportunity to guess the Damsel.
  
Q If the Damsel is chosen by the Bone-Collector, what happens?
A The Minions are not reinformed about the Damsel, as it is a once per game announcement.
  However, if there is a new Minion who has not previously been informed they would be informed.

  If guesses have been made previous to the Damsel's bones being collected,
  they do not count for this new instance of the Damsel ability,
  so the Minions have one more opportunity to guess the Damsel.

Q Does a Minion babysitting Lil' Monsta, therefore registering as the Demon, still learn if the Damsel is in play?
A Yes.

Q Can a Minion babysitting Lil' Monsta's guess the Damsel?
A Yes.

Q Can a Legion player guess the Damsel?
A Yes, as Legion player register as Minions.

Q Can the Witch who has lost their ability at three players left alive still guess the Damsel?
A Yes.

Q What is the Damsel jinx with the Spy?
A This is a hate jinx: only one of these characters can be in play.

Q What is the Damsel jinx with the Widow?
A This is a hate jinx: only one of these characters can be in play.


Q Can an Imp who was a Minion guess the Damsel?
A No.

Q Can the Damsel be the good twin to the Evil Twin?
A Yes ... but that could end the game very quickly!

Q If the Damsel is Barber swapped to another player, do the Minions get another Damsel annoucement?
A No, it is a once per game annoucement.
  
  However, if a player is swapped into having a Minion character and was not one previously, then they are told about the Damsel.

  This can result in a very bad day for the evil team if the Damsel is swapped with a Minion,
  as the good ex-Damsel-now-Minion knows somewhere there is an evil Damsel and,
  based on whether they are told that the Damsel is in play, would know whether the evil now-Damsel is alive or not and whether they can therefore be guessed to win the game.

Q Does the Monk protecting the Damsel prevent an evil win should a Minion make a correct guess?
A No, unless in the unlikely situation where the Minion is holding Lil' Monsta and guesses at night.
 
  The Monk protects against the Demon, not Minions, and only at night,
  so Monk protection does not prevent a correct Minion guess of a Damsel ending the game.  

Q Does the Poppy Grower stop the Minions learning that the Damsel is in the game?
A No.

Q Can a preached Minion still make a successful Damsel guess?
A Yes, a Minion with no ability is still a Minion.

Q Does the Magician learn that there is a Damsel in the game?
A No, they are not actually a Minion, nor can they guessing the Damsel have any effect.

Q If the Minions have already used up their Damsel guess and then the Cannibal or the Philosopher gains the Damsel ability, do the Minions get another guess?
A Yes, but they are not re-informed of the Damsel being in play so they may not know that another guess is available to them.

Q Can the dead Damsel still be chosen?
A No, once they are dead they lose their ability. Conversely, a dead Minion could choose a living Damsel.

Q If the poisoned Damsel is correctly guessed by a Minion, does their team still lose?
A No. If a Minion claims Minion and guesses the Damsel while the Damsel is drunk or poisoned, the game continues and the guess is used up.

Q Do Minions get informed of the drunk/poisoned Damsel during N1?
A Yes.

Q If the Damsel is in play, when do Minions learn it?
A During minion info.

Q If the Damsel guess has been used and the Cannibal eats the Damsel can the Minion guess the Cannibal as the Damsel?
A Yes, as it would be a new instance of the Damsel ability, the Minions would not relearn the Damsel exists but would get another guess.

Q If a good Minion is created while the Damsel is in play, will they be informed that the Damsel is in play?
A Yes.

Q If the Marionette thinks they are the Damsel, do the other Minions learn that the Damsel is in play?
A No.

Q What is the Marionette/Damsel jinx?
A The Marionette does not learn the Damsel is in play.

Q Can the Minions Damsel guess at night?
A Yes.


==================
=Devil's Advocate=
==================
Q Can the Devil’s Advocate protect from a "madness break” execution (e.g. Mutant/Cerenovus)?
A Yes.

Q If the Devil’s Advocate protects the Zombuul and then the Zombuul kills themself the same night, does the protection remain or disappear?
A It remains, so double tapping the Zombuul player that day will not end the game!

Q Is there a way for the DA to protect the same player for two days in a row?
A A new instance of the DA can protect the same player a different DA chose previously.
  You can end up with the new DA choosing the same player the previous DA did the night before with something like a Barber swap.
  Since they are a new instance of the DA, they are free to choose whomever they want.

Q There are three players alive at the end of the day: the Pukka, the Devil's Advocate and the Sailor. 
  At night the Sailor chooses the DA and the ST makes the DA drunk.
  The DA chooses to protect the Pukka and the Pukka chooses the Sailor, making them poisoned.
  The next day the Pukka is executed. Does the Pukka die?
A Yes, because at the time the DA chose to protect the Pukka the DA was drunk, so they did not protect the Pukka. 

-------------combine
Q If the DA chooses the Goon and gets drunked, and then the Goon is removed from the game by the Pit-Hag, does the protection remain on the player,
  or not since DA was drunk at the moment?
A Not, as the token was never placed down in the first place because the DA was drunk so there is nothing that can "come back" so to speak.

Q If the Devil's Advocate is drunk / poisoned at the time they choose who to protect,
  then become sober / healthy before dawn,
  is there pick safe from execution?
A No.  At their turn in the night order, the DA's ability fails to protect their pick, and no reminder token would have placed,
  so the fact that they became sober / healthy is immaterial.
-----------------




===========
=Doomsayer=
===========
Q There are four players left alive and the only living good player uses the Doomsayer.  Is the game over?
A Yes. If you are the only living player of your alignment and you doomsay, you die.

Q Can the Doomsayer kill the invoking player?
A Yes.

Q Can the Spy invoking the Doomsayer kill a good player?
A Yes, the Recluse and the Spy, due to registering as good or evil, can result in a Doomsayer death of any alignment.
  The Spy and the Recluse can also both die to anyone using the Doomsayer as well.
  The Storyteller can make use of this for game balance.


=========
=Dreamer=
=========
Q If the Dreamer targets an evil Townsfolk (Bounty Hunter / Mezepheles), what are they shown as the "evil" and "good" roles?
A 
  * "Good" characters are Townsfolk and Outsiders - blue tokens.
  * "Evil" characters are Demons and Minions - red tokens.

  The player's alignment is unimportant, they still have a good character, and that is what is shown as the good role. 
  So an evil Oracle for example might be Dreamer seen as the Oracle or the Cerenovus.

Q Could the Dreamer who picked the Recluse see a character other than the Recluse for their good character?
A Yes.

Q Can the Dreamer choose the same player repeatedly?
A Yes, the Dreamer's only restriction is not themselves and not Travellers.
  Picking the same player would likely result in the ST giving them the same answers,
  unless the demon switches to/from the Vortox or drunkening / poisoning is involved.




=======
=Drunk=
=======
Q Is the Townsfolk that the Marionette or the Drunk thinks that they are considered "in play"?
A No.

Q If the Philosopher chooses the Drunk, what happens with the philo-drunk Drunk? / What happens if the Drunk is poisoned or drunked?
A Nothing.

  Any drunk or poisoned player is deceived that their ability is still working.
  The Drunk's ability is that they believe that they are a Townsfolk, so they just get treated like the Townsfolk they think they are.

Q Can the ST lie to the Drunk who thinks they are the Cult Leader about their alignment?
A Yes, but lying about alignment is not recommended as it is not fun.

Q Does the dead Drunk have an ability? For example, the Drunk who thinks that they are the Ravenkeeper.
A The Drunk who believes they are the Ravenkeeper is woken when they die.

Q Is the Drunk affected by the Vortox?
A _The_ Drunk is actually an Outsider, deceived into thinking that they are a Townsfolk,
  and Outsiders are not affected by the Vortox's ability.
  So the information the Drunk gets from the ability they think they have is not affected by Vortox, and can be true.
  
  However, in a game with a (healthy, sober and alive) Vortox, the drunk or poison status of Townsfolk is irrelevant - their abilities must yield false info.

--
Q On a script with (say) the Pit-Hag (or even the Barber) 
  it is legal to tell the Drunk that they have changed character to a different Townsfolk, because it still satisfies the 'you think you are a Townsfolk'-part of 'the Drunk'?
A Yes, as long as the ST makes them think they are a Townsfolk, it is fine. It is real fun to make them think they got turned into the Farmer sometimes.

Q Can the ST tell the Drunk that they turned into another Townsfolk character to the one they currently believe they are, to simulate the Pit-Hag?
A Yes.
---

----------------------------- combine
Q When does the ST decide who the Drunk character is?
A If the character has setup abilities then it should be decided that they will be drunk before tokens go in the bag
  and this decision cannot change after token distribution. Otherwise it is up to the ST.

  Most STs assign the Drunk once tokens have been handed out and know the grim, allowing them to balance the game much better.
  The entry for the Drunk states "while preparing the first night", which would be once tokens are already handed out

  The ST can decide beforehand to make the Drunk a specific character regardless of token distribution.
  They can also decide to wait until after token distribution. Both are fine.

Q Can the ST decide which character the Drunk is after the tokens are distributed?
A Yes, but you often need to decide beforehand if you want the Drunk to think they are Balloonist or Huntsman,
  because Drunk does not have the setup ability that would change outsider count.
---------------------------------

Q If the Drunk is Pit-Hagged into play, can you show them an already in play character?
A Yes, it is just on setup that the Drunk (and the Marionette) cannot be a role already in play.

Q Can the Drunk think that they are an in-play character?
A No, unless it is a Bootlegger game.

Q Is the Drunk, drunk?
A Yes.
  The Drunk registers as drunk to any abilities that are concerned with drunkeness.
  So the healthy and sober Acrobat that neighbours the living Drunk will die.



==========
=Engineer=
==========
Q Can the Recluse misregister when the Engineer is picking the Demon or the Minions?
A Yes, but don't.

  Registering the Recluse as a Minion or as the Demon could cause them to be changed by the Engineer, or affect which characters are changed.
  But the Recluse is an Outsider so it is best not to use their ability like this.
  
Q If the Engineer chooses the Marionette, does an existing Minion become one, or does a Demon-neighboring good player become one?
A An existing Minion becomes one. 
  The Marionette's "you neighbor the Demon" is a setup ability (encased in []), so creating one mid game does not apply that condition.

Q The Bounty Hunter is in play, and the Engineer is evil. 
  The three Minions decide to pass Lil' Monsta to the Engineer.
  The Engineer changes the Demon. 
  Does this game now have three Minions and one Demon?
A Yes, the current babysitter becomes the Demon. Their alignment does not change, so they remain evil.

Q The Pit-Hag turns himself into an evil Townsfolk, then the Engineer chooses which Minions exist.  Does the ex PH turn back into a Minion?
A No, the ex PH remains an evil Townsfolk.
  The Engineer does not change character types; the ST accepts however many Minions she picks to not make it obvious, but only makes use of the first few.
  so the Engineer would simply fail to create whatever Minion she chose.

Q Can the Engineer affect the Alchemist's Minion ability?
A If the Engineer causes the Alchemist to have an in-play Minion ability,
  then the Alchemist will need to swap to an out-of-play one.
  Otherwise, the Alchemist is not affected by the Engineer, as they are not themselves a Minion, they just have a Minion ability.

Q What is the Legion jinx with the Engineer?
A Legion and the Engineer cannot both be in play at the start of the game.
  If the Engineer creates Legion, most players (including all evil players) become evil Legion.

Q Can the Engineer choose Lil' Monsta to be in play?
A Yes, the former Demon becomes a not-in-play Minion of the ST's choice and is babysitting Lil’ Monsta.

Q What happens to the babysitter if the Engineer swaps Lil' Monsta to another Demon?
A The current babysitter becomes that Demon instead of whatever character they were previously.

Q How does the Engineer bringing the Marionette into play work?
A 
  * The Marionette does not need to neighbour the Demon.
  * The now-Marionette is not told that they are the Marionette, instead they are shown the "you are" info token and any Townsfolk or Outsider token.
  * They are not told anything about their alignment as it has not changed.
 
Q What does the Marionette learn if they are swapped to another Minion by the Engineer?
A They would be shown the "you are" info token and their new Minion character.
  They would be told nothing about their alignment as it has not changed.


===========
=Evil Twin=
===========
Q Does the game end if the only two players that are alive are the twins?
A Yes, evil wins.

  Although no win conditions have been met in that scenario 
  STs usually end the game if the Demon and the two twins are still alive as it is basically impossible for good to win at that point.
  Evil does not explicitly require the Demon to survive to final two to win.
  They just usually do, since good wins if there are no alive Demons.
  But the Evil Twin specifically prevents that win from happening so long as both twins are alive.
  So despite the Demon being dead, as only two players left alive is evil's win condition, evil wins.

Q Could the twins ever get bad information?
  i.e. is it possible that they think the other twin is someone else other than their actual twin?
A The Sweetheart drunked player who is turned into the Evil Twin would learn wrong info,
  but would not cause anyone else to wake though, so only the drunk ET would get wrong info in this scenario.

Q If the Courtier drinks with the Evil Twin and town kills the good twin, what happens when drunkeness ends?
A Nothing. The good player in the twin pair was executed while the Evil Twin ability was drunk and it does not trigger retrospectively.

Q The Evil Twin knows the role of a twinned good player.
  If the Pit-Hag turns a good player into the Evil Twin,
  does the resulting good aligned Evil Twin know the role of their twinned evil player?
A Yes.

Q Does the Evil Twin find out if their twin changes character?
A Yes, the Evil Twin always knows the ability of their good twin, so should be immediately informed of their new character.

  However, if the Evil Twin is turned into something else the good twin does not learn this.

Q The Pit-Hag turns a good player into the Evil Twin, who is then twinned with an evil player. 
  If the evil player is killed does that cause another evil player to become the evil aligned twin,
  since the Evil Twin is still alive and needs a counterpart?
A No. The twins only change if the _alignment_ of one of them changes. It is allowable to have a dead twin.

Q The Evil Twin is N1 droisoned (accidental poisoning in a Poppy Grower game).  How should the ST run this?
A The ET is decieved as to their ability working, so they are told an arbitrary player and a character. The good twin learns nothing.
  When the ET is sober / healthy, if they learned incorrect info then they will learn the real info, and the good twin will learn the ET.

  In SnV where the droisoned ET is rare, and impossible N1, STs will often wake the twins together, and have them make eye contact.
  But on custom scripts where there is a chance of a droisoned ET it is best practice to wake the twins separately.

  While the ET is droisoned, executing the good twin does nothing.

Q What happens if the good twin in an Evil Twin pair becomes evil? 
A A new good Twin would need to be assigned.
  The Twins must always be of opposing alignment,
  so if they are ever the same,
  the good twin has to become someone else.
  The Evil Twin would wake with their new good twin that night to each learn each other.

Q If a new Evil Twin is created (Pit-Hag / Hatter) how is it run?
A Each twin wakes individually to learn who their twin is and what character it is.
  The good twin does not have to be alive and generally should not be if it happens late game when the good team cannot win.

==========
=Exorcist=
==========
Q What happens if the Exorcist picks the Lunatic?
A Nothing. The ST can always deceive the Lunatic into thinking the Exorcist picked them in any game with or without the Exorcist in play.

=========
=Fang Gu=
=========
Q If the Fang Gu picks the Philosopher Outsider, does the Philo become the Fang Gu? 
A No. The Philosopher gains an Outsider ability, but does not become an Outsider.

Q Does the ST wake up the Outsider when the Fang Gu kills them?
A If the Fang Gu kills an Outsider without a jump being possible, the Outsider just dies and does not wake.
  If the Fang Gu jumps, the Outsider is woken and informed of their new alignment and character.

--
Q If the Snake Charmer picks the Fang Gu, can the new Fang Gu jump again, if the original Fang Gu had already jumped?
A No, the Fang Gu has a unique reminder token that is placed in the middle of the grim if a jump happens
 and remains there even if the Fang Gu goes out of play and comes back into play.

Q If the Snake Charmer becomes an already jumped Fang Gu can the Fang Gu jump again?
A No, the Fang Gu jump is a hard once per game, no way around it.

Q If the Fang Gu jumps, then is turned into a different Demon by the Pit-Hag then turned back by the Engineer, are they allowed to jump again?
A No. The Fang Gu's jump is a global one. In person, the "once" token gets placed in the middle of the Grim and stays there for the rest of the game.
---

Q What happens when a Fang Gu is protected (Monk / Innkeeper) and kills an Outsider for first time? 
A The Fang Gu jump is a "package deal" so if they cannot die there is no jump and the Outsider dies.

  The once per game jump is not used up so if the FG later choose another Outsider while both are able to die, a jump can occur.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns himself into an Outsider and the Fang Gu kills him, does the jump happen?
A If it is the first Outsider the Fang Gu has killed, then yes.

Q The Spirit of Ivory with the Bounty Hunter and Fang Gu. The BH adds one evil on setup. What happens if the Fang Gu attacks the first Outsider? A good Fang Gu?
A The Outsider just dies.

Q If the Fang Gu hits the droisoned Recluse does she still jump?
A In that instance, the Fang Gu has to jump, because the Recluse would be unable to register as anything other than the Recluse, an Outsider.

-------combine
Q The Fang Gu is protected (Innkeeper / Monk). They choose to kill the Barber (first Outsider picked).  What happens?
A The jump is blocked so the Barber dies, and the ST offers the Barber swap to the (probably confused) Fang Gu.

Q If the Fang Gu picks the Barber what happens?
A If the Fang Gu has yet to jump this game, and the Fang Gu can die, then the Fang Gu dies and the Barber becomes the evil Fang Gu and there is no Barber swap.

  Otherwise the Barber dies and the Fang Gu can then swap two people's characters.

========
=Farmer=
========
Q If the grandchild Farmer is killed, could the Grandmother become a Farmer and not die?
A Yes, because they are now a Farmer and therefore no longer have the Grandmother ability causing them to die.
  If the Grandmother instead dies to her ability then she is no longer a legitimate new Farmer choice.

Q What does a Barista doubled Farmer do?
A The Farmer dying would cause two good living players to become Farmers.

Q What is the Leviathan jinx with the Farmer?
A If the Leviathan is in play and a Farmer dies by execution, a good player becomes a Farmer that night.

Q If the Lycanthrope kills the Farmer and then becomes the Farmer, can there be other deaths that night?
A Yes, as there is no longer a Lycanthrope ability in play preventing deaths.

Q Does the Mathematician get a +1 if a player becomes a Farmer, preventing them from using their previous ability?
A No. As far as the Mathematician is concerned that player is the Farmer and their ability is working fine.

Q Can the Mayor bounce a kill on to the Farmer, triggering the Farmer's ability?
A Yes.  This could even cause the Mayor to become a Farmer.

Q Can the good Goon become a Farmer when the Farmer dies?
A Yes.  The previous Farmer player is not drunked as they are not themselves choosing the Goon with the Farmer ability, the ST is.

Q Does a player waking at night to learn that they are now the Farmer register to the Chambermaid?
A Only if that player woke up due to their ability prior to becoming the Farmer, otherwise no, as changing character is not waking to their ability.

Q Can the Gambler who gambled wrong and died become the Farmer later the same night?
A No, as they are already dead.

Q If a non-Farmer gains the Farmer ability (Cannibal / Philosopher / Pixie / ...) and dies at night, what do they turn another alive good player into?
A They become a Farmer, it does not matter what their actual character was.

Q Suppose, due to the Farmer ability, there are two Farmers in the game and a Washerwoman is created after. 
  Can the Washerwoman be shown both Farmer players as the Farmer?
A Yes.

Q If all good players are Farmers and one is killed by the Demon, is one of the Farmers still woken up and told that they are a Farmer?
A Yes, it is part of the Farmer's ability.

Q When does the Farmer proc at night, right after the kill or at their night order spot? 
A As soon as they are dead.

Q If a multikill Demon (Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / Po) kills the Farmer as their first pick,
  can their next choices be woken up and told that they are Farmers before their deaths are processed?
A Yes.  Probably best not to though.

============
=Fearmonger=
============
Q Does a successful Fearmonger-execution of an evil Townsfolk or Outsider (Bounty Hunter turned / flipped Cult Leader / flipped Goon / Mezepheles turned / ...)
  or Minion or Demon (Poppygrower game)
  result in a loss for evil.
A Yes. Sometimes the Fearmonger is better off not nominating until they know more about their target.

Q If the Recluse is Fearmonger-executed, who wins?
A The ST can pick a side, but since Fearmonger wins are rare, it should be an evil win.

Q Can the Spy register as good and be Fearmonger-executed, resulting in an evil win?
A Yes but don't.

  The ST can pick which side wins, but it would be harsh on the good team to have the Fearmonger-executed Spy misregister, so it would be best to have evil lose.

Q If a player in a Revolutionary pair is Fearmonger-executed, could they register falsely?
A Yes but don't, as this is then the ST picking the winner.

Q If the Witch cursed Fearmonger nominates and dies but gets their target executed, does their ability still trigger?
A No, they are dead and have no ability.

Q If the Sweetheart is Fearmonger-executed, can they drunk the Fearmonger and prevent their win?
A No.  The Sweetheart's team loses before the drunking happens.

Q If the Fearmonger is successful in executing their target, could the Scapegoat be executed instead, preventing the game from ending?
A Yes, but the ST should not do this as presumably the evil team worked hard to get the Fearmonger target executed and deserve the win!

Q Can the Fearmonger win if they nominate their pick and they are executed due to a madness break (Mutant / Cerenovus target / ...)?
A No, their choice needs to be executed as a result of the Fearmonger’s nomination, not a madness execution.

Q Who wins if the Fearmonger picks the evil Goblin and nominates and executes them?
A Good wins.

  If both the Goblin's and the Fearmonger's abilities are satisfied
  causing both a good and evil win,
  then the result is a good win as good wins on ties.

Q Can the Fearmonger win trigger if the Bishop is in play?
A No.

  The Fearmonger is completely neutralised since they cannot nominate in order to satisfy their ability.  This combination of characters is best avoided.

Q The Alchemist Fearmonger chooses the Goblin and successfully executes them.  Does good win?
A Yes, since good wins ties.

Q What happens if the Fearmonger chooses herself, then nominates herself and is executed? 
A The Fearmonger's team loses.

Q If the Fearmonger nominates and executes the Lleech host which team will win?
A Evil wins.

  The Fearmonger ability trumps the executing the demon win condition,
  as ability wins, usually, trump normal game wins.

  Usually, because exceptions are made in rulings if, for example, good could never win otherwise.

Q If the Fearmonger ability enters midgame (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Plague Doctor) how is it run?
A If a player gains the Fearmonger, any choices they made as their previous character are not relevant to the Fearmonger announcement;
  their first pick will cause an announcement regardless of who it is. 


=========
=Fiddler=
=========
Q If the Fiddler is in play, can the Demon choose the Spy?
A No.

Q If there is a circle where the Demon does not kill and the town does not nominate, what happens?
A The ST can use the Fiddler, a Fabled character.
  At night, the ST wakes the Demon who must choose one good player.
  The next day, the town votes between the two on who should win. Everyone can vote, it uses no ghost votes, abilities cannot affect this vote, etc.

===========
=Fisherman=
===========
Q Does Fisherman advice have to be specific and can it be affected by the Vortox and misregistration?
A The Fisherman gets whatever the ST wants to give them.
  That can be specific or vague, however they want. Misregistration can affect it if the ST wants, and the Vortox must affect it.

============
=Flowergirl=
============
Q If the Flowergirl is dead during the day and resurrected the next night (Al-Hadikhia / Professor / ...),
  are they told if the Demon voted the previous day?
A Yes.

======
=Fool=
======
Q Does the Tea Lady protected Fool get spent when attacked?
A No, any protection ability lets the Fool keeps their ability.

Q Can the Pit-Hag's deaths are arbitrary ability kill an unspent Fool?
A Yes.  Effectively the Fool was targeted twice so it appears that they were one-shot.

Q Does a dead player turned into the Fool come back to life as the once killed Fool?
A No, they stay dead.

================
=Fortune Teller=
================
Q If the Fortune Teller checks an Imp who just starpassed and they are not a red herring will they show up as a Demon ?
A Yes. Starpassing does not change the Imp’s character, just makes them dead and creates a new Imp.
  The FT just checks if any of the two players is a Demon, or registering as one, and a dead Imp is still a Demon.
  Some abilities specify 'the' Demon, which refers to the actual Demon, and these abilities target any alive Demons first,
  or players registering as one, and only if no Demon is alive do they target dead Demons.


Q If the poisoned Fortune Teller picks their red herring do they have to get a yes? 
A If the FT is poisoned, they can get either yes or no, regardless of who is picked,
  unless it is a Vortox game.


=========
=Gambler=
=========
Q Does the Gambler die immediately at the time of the gamble or at the end of the night?
A They die at their turn in the night order.  Generally deaths are immediate, just only announced at dawn, assuming they are still dead then.

Q Can the Gambler die from gambling the Recluse as the Recluse?
A Yes.

==========
=Gangster=
==========
Q If the unspent Fool is attacked by the Gangster, are they safe?
A Yes, and their ability is used.

Q What happens if the Gangster is holding Lil’ Monsta and kills the grandchild with their ability during the day?
A The Grandmother dies immediately too.

Q What happens if the Gangster is holding Lil’ Monsta and kills the King with their ability during the day?
A The Choirboy learns the Gangster is the Demon that night.

Q What happens if the Gangster is holding Lil’ Monsta and kills the Sage with their ability during the day?
A The Sage learns two players including the Gangster that night.

Q Can the Gangster kill a Tea Lady protected player?
A No.

Q Is the sober Sailor safe from the Gangster?
A Yes.

Q What happens if the Gangster is holding Lil’ Monsta and picks the Soldier with their ability?
A The Soldier does not die.

Q Can the Gangster kill their neighbour who is favoured by the Storm Catcher?
A No.

Q Can the Gangster trigger the Virgin's ability?
A No, the Gangster's choice is not a nomination.

Q Does the Witch-cursed Gangster die if they use their ability?
A No, the Gangster's choice is not a nomination.

Q Can the Scapegoat die instead of the Gangster's target?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q Do Gangster kills prevent the Vortox's win condition?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q Are Gangster kills included in the Leviathan's execution count?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q If the Gangster kills the Demon in a Mastermind game, does the game continue?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution, so the Mastermind's ability is not triggered and the good team wins.

Q If the Goblin publicly claims to be the Goblin and is then Gangster killed, do evil win?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution. 

Q If the Gangster kills the Evil Twin's good twin, do evil win?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution, and the good twin must be executed to trigger evil's win condition.

Q Can the Devil's Advocate prevent the Gangster's kill?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q If the Gangster kills the Saint, do evil win?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution, and the Saint must die by execution to trigger evil's win condition.

Q If the Gangster kills a Minion, does that trigger the Minstrel?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution, and the Minion needs to have died by execution to trigger the Minstrel's ability.

Q Can the Cannibal gain the ability of the Gangster's kill?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q Can the Pacifist prevent the Gangster's kill?
A No, the Gangster's kill is not an execution.

Q Can the Undertaker see who the Gangster killed?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q Is a Gangster kill an execution?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution. 

========
=Goblin=
========
Q If the public Goblin is executed while protected by the Devil's Advocate, does their team still win?
A Yes, the Goblin does not need to die as a result of the execution to trigger their win condition. 

Q If the public Vigormortis-killed Goblin is executed, does their team win?
A Yes, they still have their ability through the Vigormortis and the Goblin ability does not require the Goblin to die from the execution.


===========
=Godfather=
===========
Q In a base 0 Outsider game, can the Godfather's Outsider modifier by -1?
A Yes, just as the Vigormortis's modifier is -1 in a base 0 Outsider game.

Q Can the Spy register as an Outsider to the Godfather? 
A Yes.
  Doing this during setup would be an Outsider ability hurting evil so not recommended.
  But the ST might want to do this after the Spy is executed to give the evil team an extra Godfather kill.

Q Can the Recluse register as the Spy who registers as an Outsider to the Godfather?
A The Recluse who does not misregister as another role would ping the Godfather.
  If the Recluse registered as the Spy then she would not show up to the Godfather, which would be an Outsider ability hurting evil, so usually not recommended.

Q The Godfather and the Recluse are in play. Must the ST show the Recluse token to the Godfather or can she skip them due to their ability to register as a Minion/Demon?
A The ST could do that, but STs should generally not use Outsiders to hinder evil, at least not during N1.

  The GF could probably figure out that that means the Recluse is in play, unless there is other Outsider manipulation in play,
  or they might suspect that they are poisoned, perhaps accidentally by the Poisoner in a Poppy Grower game, so mistrust their info.

Q If the Pit-Hag creates Outsiders that the Godfather did not see at the start,
  does the Godfather get to kill, if one of the new Outsiders dies?
A The Godfather gets to kill if any Outsider died, even one that did not exist at the start of the game.

Q If an Outsider is executed and the following night the Godfather is either resurrected (Al-Hadikhia) or created (Pit-Hag / Hatter)
  do they get a kill?
A Yes, the Godfather is backward-looking so can potentially get a kill.  They should be woken at their turn in the night order for their choice.

Q Can the Hatter's death leading to a midgame Godfather give the new Godfather a kill?
A Yes.  

Q Does a Godfather created midgame (Pit-Hag / Hatter) learn the in-play Outsiders?
A Yes.  Wake her up, inform her of her new character and the in play Outsiders regardless of their living status, then put her back to sleep.

=======
=Golem=
=======
Q Can the Pacifist protect the Golem's nominee?
A No, the Golem's nominee is not dying as a result of an execution.

Q Can the Devil's Advocate protect the Golem's nominee?
A No, the Golem's nominee is not dying as a result of an execution.

Q Can the Recluse registering as the Demon survive the Golem's nomination.
A Yes.

Q Could an evil player bluffing as the Golem nominate the Tinker cause them to die?
A Yes, successfully simulating the Golem.

Q Does Barista doubling the Golem have any effect?
A The Golem is still limited to only nominating once per game, 
  but when they nominate, that player dies twice.
  So the Barista-doubled Golem could kill an unused Fool completely in one nomination.

  If the Golem has already used their one nomination, the Barista has no effect on them.

Q Can the unspent Fool survive the Golem's nomination?
A Yes, and their ability is used.

Q If the Tea Lady's neighbours are both good do they survive the Golem's nomination?
A Yes.

Q If the Golem nominates the player favoured by the Storm Catcher, do they die?
A No, they can only die by execution, and a Golem nomination is not an execution.

Q Can the Golem kill the sober Sailor by nominating them?
A No.

Q If the Golem nominates and kills a player, then the Pit-Hag changes them from the Golem and then back to the Golem, do they get to nominate again?
A Yes, as it is a new instance of the ability.

Q Can a player that has previously nominated and becomes the Golem, nominate?
A Yes.

Q Can the Golem kill the Vizier?
A No. The Vizier's ability states that they cannot die during the day.

Q Can the poisoned Golem nominate again?
A No, this is cheating.

Q The Golem nominates the unproced Virgin. Who is executed?  Both are sober/healthy and the Virgin has their ability.
A The Golem is an Outsider so does not proc the Virgin. The Virgin dies to the Golem's nomination because they are not the Demon.
  This is not an execution though, as the Golem's ability just causes a death.
  If it were instead a Philosopher Golem or a Cannibal Golem, the ST could let both abilities resolve.

Q Does the Witch-cursed Golem still get to kill?
A If the Golem is cursed by the Witch, is sober and healthy and nominates a non-Demon, both players would die immediately.

Q If the Devil's Advocate protects someone who is not the Demon, and the Golem nominates them, do they die?
A Yes. The Devil's Advocate protects against death by execution, but the Golem's nomination kills someone but it is not an execution, so there will be no protection there.

Q Can the Golem trigger the Goon's ability?
A No.

  The Golem is not selecting the Goon at night, so is not drunked, and kills the Goon who dies with whatever alignment they are at the time.




======
=Goon=
======
Q The Innkeeper picks player X and the unpicked Goon, becoming Goon drunk.
  That night the Shabaloth picks the Goon and then player X in that order.
  Does player X die?
A Yes.

  The moment the Innkeeper chose the Goon, they were drunked, and no protection was placed - the ST does not place their reminder tokens in the grim.
  When the Goon dies first, the Innkeeper sobers - the ST removes the Goon drunk reminder token.
  But noone is protected tonight - the Innkeeper tokens were never placed in the grim.

Q The Goon specifies that a player has to choose them in order for their ability to trigger, 
  but how about when the ST picks them (Lil' Monsta kill / Gossip kill / Mayor bounce / ...)
A The ST pick does not count, so the Goon would simply die, drunking no one and no possible alignment changes.

Q Can a Minion guessing the Goon is the Damsel, flip the Goon's alignment?
A No, the Minion is not choosing the Goon with their ability.

Q If the Pit-Hag selects the Goon and tries to turn them into a role that is already in play, what happens?
A If the PH is the first player to target the Goon that night, then the PH is drunked and the Goon turns/stays evil.
  Whether the chosen role would have worked does not matter, the Goon’s ability is about a player choosing them not whether the choice has an effect.

Q If a charged Po happens to select the Goon as the third kill and the Goon has not been selected yet and causes the Po to become drunk,
  do the first two kills happen or would they fail because the Po becomes drunk before dawn? 
A They happen. Except for the Al-Hadikhia, which has different mechanics to other Demons, players die the moment a Demon chooses them.

Q Is the Goon awakened to learn they switch alignment?
A Yes, every time.
  When the Goon changes alignment, they wake (straight after the player who triggers them) and learn this. Note, that this also registers to the Chambermaid.

Q Does the drunk evil Goon stay evil?
A Yes.

Q If the Lunatic picks the Goon, and is the first player to do so that night,
  is the Goon's ability triggered,
  resulting in the Goon, if evil, turning good, and the Demon not learning who the Lunatic chose?
A Yes.

Q Does a bounce off of Mayor onto Goon, turn the Goon evil?
A Bouncing off the Mayor comes from the original source, but is not the result of being chosen by a player (the Mayor, not the Goon, was chosen by a player) 
  so this would not turn the Goon.

--
Q If the Pukka selects the Goon first, is the Goon still poisoned and dies after the Pukka becomes sober?
A No, in this instance the Goon will turn evil, the Pukka-poison is not applied and the Pukka is Goon-drunk. 
  No one will die to the Pukka this night, and the previously poisoned player is temporarily unpoisoned from the Pukka.
  When the Pukka becomes sober and healthy (next night probably), 
  the player who was poisoned prior to choosing the Goon will be poisoned again and die later that night after the Pukka chooses a new target 
  (so long as that new target is not the unchosen Goon again!).

Q How does the whole interaction between the Pukka and the Goon work?
A If the Goon has been picked already that night -> Goon becomes poisoned, and dies next night
  If the Goon has not been picked yet -> Pukka becomes drunk, Goon becomes evil, no one dies tonight to the Demon.
  previously Pukka poisoned player is temporarily unpoisoned for as long as the Pukka has lost their ability 
  When the Pukka regains their ability, the previously Pukka poisoned player dies after the Pukka picks again.
--

Q If the Assassin picks the Goon first, the Goon dies, but do they also become evil?
A Yes, the Goon dies and becomes evil.

Q If the player selecting the Goon to die is made sober and healthy by the Barista, does the Goon still change alignment, or does the death override this?
A Yes, the Goon changes alignment irrespective of whether they manage to drunk the responsible player.

Q What happens when the Widow poisons the Goon? 
A If the Widow chooses the Goon, the Widow is drunk and the Goon turns evil but remains healthy so can be turned good again on future nights.
  No-one is told that the Widow is in play on N1.
  On N2, when the Widow is now sober, a good player is told the Widow is in play, but the Widow has no ongoing poison.

Q If the Gambler gambles the Goon, does this make the Gambler drunk and the Goon turn good, or does the Gambler ability not trigger the Goon's ability?
A If the Gambler picks the player with the Goon ability (what they gamble them as is not relevant),
  the Gambler is drunked, and the Goon, if the Gambler was the first to pick them that night, is turned good.
  If the Gambler gambles another player as the Goon, the Goon would have no effect on the Gambler.

Q Can a Drunk make a Goon change alignment / Can a drunked or poisoned player flip the Goon / Can the Lleech host flip the Goon / Can the Lunatic flip the Goon?
A Yes.
  The player is still choosing, which is what the Goon cares about, not whether that choosing would actually do anything.
  The alignment change comes from the Goon's ability, so the Goon is the only player that needs to be healthy/sober for it to happen.

Q If the Poisoner targets the Goon and the Pit-Hag changes the Goon into a demon
  is the result an evil demon or a good demon?
A If the Poisoner was the first person to target the Goon at night, the Goon turns evil, the Poisoner is Goon-drunk and the Goon is unpoisoned.
  If the Pit-Hag hits the Goon afterwards, the Goon just changes character, not alignment.
  So they would be an evil demon and the Poisoner is no longer Goon-drunk.

Q What happens if the Lleech picks the Goon as their host?
A If they are the first player to do so that night, the Lleech is Goon drunk and the Goon turns evil, but is still the host.
  Being drunked the Lleech fails to poison the Goon,
  so the Goon’s ability then continues to function normally throughout the game, despite being the host.

Q If the Lleech picks the Goon N1 as the host, what happens?
A  from ⁠experimental-how-to-run 
  "Goon: If selected as host on N1, makes the Lleech drunk until dusk and the Goon turns evil.
  If the Goon is then executed that first day, the Lleech does not die as they are drunk.
  The Goon is sober all game, but if the Goon dies after the first day, the Lleech dies too."

Q What happens if the Barber dies and the Demon chooses two players, one of whom is the good Goon?
A The Goon's ability is "the first player to choose you with their ability",
  so the Barber swap happens normally because it is not the Demon's ability making them choose the Goon.
  e.g. if it is the Savant and the Goon then the 
  Savant becomes the Goon and the Goon becomes the Savant. No alignment changes or Goon drunking.

  Using this logic, the Barber allows you to use the Goon to make two players evil,
  assuming it is a game where the Barber is not revived easily or made new. 
  Lots of Barber combos can lead to multiple evils so most STs solve this with a Fabled, Spirit of Ivory,
  which stops too many evils being made.

Q The Courtier targets the Goon.  What happens?
A If the Courtier is the first to pick the Goon that night, then the Goon turns good and the Courtier is drunk.
﻿
Q If the Philosopher chooses the Goon ability, and there is an actual Goon in play, what happens?
A The Goon drunks the Philo, becomes their alignment, and then the Philo is left with no ability.

Q In the almanac for Goon it says if the Courtier chooses the character Goon, they become Goon drunk,
  and turn the Goon good if they are the first person interacting with the Goon.
  The text for Courtier is "choose a character". Now the text for Cerenovus is "choose a player and a character".
  So rules as written, if the Cerenovus attempts to make a player mad as the Goon,
  the Goon character is chosen and the Cerenovus would be made Goon drunk and turn the Goon evil, correct?
A No. The Courtier is targeting a player by way of choosing a character - only the player with that character token could possibly become Courtier drunk.
  (it is kind of like even though they are not pointing at the Goon player, their ability still is)

  The Cerenovus is not choosing the Goon in the same sense. They are not interacting with the Goon player just by pointing at Goon on the character list.

Q Can the Goon drunk the Mezepheles? 
A No, the Mez is not targeting any one player/role specifically.

Q Can the Goon drunk the Gossip?
A No.  Gossip kills are chosen by the ST not a player,
  so if the Gossip makes a true statement and the ST kills off the Goon with the Gossip ability,
  no part of the Goon's ability is triggered (drunkening or alignment flipping), the Goon just dies.

Q If the Bounty Hunter learns the Goon as evil, can the Goon's ability trigger?
A No. The BH being shown the Goon is not choosing the Goon with their ability, so they cannot be made drunk or flip the Goon.

Q What happens if the ST decides to target the Goon when the Ojo misses?
A Then the Goon dies, because that is not a player choosing them. 

Q Can the Goon drunk Lil' Monsta?
A (Caveat: there is no official LM write up)
  No, the LM just kills the Goon.
  
  The LM/Goon interaction is extrapolated from the same logic as Gossip, Mayor, Legion, Ojo, ...
  in that a kill is being sent to the Goon by ST decision.
  As the Goon is not explicitly chosen by another player, the ability is untriggered and the kill processes normally.

Q What happens if the Fang Gu picks the Goon?
A If they are the first to pick the Goon that night, the Goon becomes evil and the Fang Gu becomes drunk. 
  If someone already picked the Goon, and the Fang Gu has yet to jump this game, the Goon becomes the evil Fang Gu and the current Fang Gu dies.
  if someone already picked the Goon and there has already been a Fang Gu jump, then the Goon just dies.

Q If the Po picks the Pacifist, the Goon and the Minstrel in that order, would only the Pacifist die, since the Goon makes the Po drunk saving themselves and the Minstrel?
  Or would all of them survive because of the Goon?
A If the Goon has not been picked yet in that night, only the Pacifist dies.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns a good player into the Goon, do they become evil?
A No, because they were not in play at the time of pick so the Goon has not not been targeted.
  So they would stay good, at least until another evil player chooses them first in the night. 
  And that does include if a different evil player chooses the new Goon that same night, before any good players do.


========
=Gossip=
========
Q If the dead Gossip made a gossip during the day, then is resurrected (Al-Hadikhia / Professor), will there be a Gossip kill?
A Yes.

Q If a player who is not the Gossip during the day makes a correct gossip and then that night becomes the Gossip 
  (sufficiently mad Pixie / Philosopher choosing Gossip / Cannibal eating the Gossip / Pit-Hag creating the Gossip / Barber swap / ...)
  do they Gossip kill?
A Yes.  It is recommended that the ST tracks any player's gossips who could potentially become the Gossip.

Q If the Gossip makes a correct gossip during the day
  but that night is swapped to a different role (Pit-Hagging / Barber swap / turned into the Farmer / ...)
  is there a Gossip kill that night?
A No.

Q Could the Gossip making a correct gossip kill the Farmer, triggering the Farmer's ability?
A Yes.  The Gossip could even become the Farmer themselves.

Q Can the Gossip's kill target an immortal player? Or should a player always die?
A The Gossip can target a player who cannot die, but this is not recommended since the idea is that the extra kill tells the Gossip something.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns a player into the Gossip, and that player made a true statement the previous day, does the Gossip trigger at their turn in the night order?
A Yes.

Q Can "there are two Demons" be a correct Gossip statement when the Recluse is in play?
A Yes, if the Recluse is registering as a Demon for it.

Q How is the Gossip affected by poisoning?
A The Gossip's ability at night is "backwards-looking" and checks if whatever they gossiped was true, and if so, kills a player.
  This means that it is important whether the Gossip is poisoned when the kill would happen, not when they made the Gossip.
  So being poisoned or healthy when making a gossip is irrelevant, if they are poisoned at night when the kill would happen, it will not happen, but if they
  are healthy, it will happen if applicable.

Q The Gossip correctly gossips during the day that they are executed.  Is the Gossip kill triggered that night, or does a dead Gossip mean no kill?
A No Gossip kill.
  The Gossip is a backwards-checking ability.
  Whenever it gets to the Gossip’s turn in the night order,  assuming they are sober and healthy,
  their ability attacks a player if it detects the statement they said that day was true.
  In this case, the Gossip is dead at their turn in the night order, therefore, they cannot kill anyone. 

  The timing of the Gossip statement itself does not matter for anything — even if the Gossip themselves is drunk or poisoned at time of said gossip,
  they still kill if they become sober that night.
  The statement is only a trigger for their actual ability, which is "Each night*, a player dies if the gossip that day was true." 

=============
=Grandmother=
=============
Q If the grandchild dies when the Grandmother is protected or droisoned,
  what happens the next night when the grandchild is still dead and Gran is no longer protected/droisoned?
A They remain alive.

Q The Demon kills the grandchild at night while the Monk protects the Grandmother.
  Does the Grandmother die, or is she safe enough from the demon?
A The Grandmother dies. They die to their own ability, not the Demon's.
  Now if Grandmother was Innkeeper protected, they would be safe.

Q If the Demon picks a grandchild Gambler who has died to their own gamble, does the Grandmother survive?
A Yes. The demon must kill the Grandchild in order for the Grandmother to attack themselves. In this case, the Gambler is dead and cannot be killed again.

Q What happens if the Grandmother is poisoned on N1?
A The ST still marks a good player as the grandchild and can then show a different player to the poisoned Grandmother.
  If the real grandchild dies to the Demon then the Grandmother, as long as she is not droisoned, will die regardless of if that is who she saw.

Q Can the Grandmother learn as their grandchild the Townsfolk turned evil by the Bounty Hunter?
A No, the Grandmother's ability is that they start knowing a good player.

============
=Gunslinger=
============
Q If a vote to exile the Gunslinger does not succeed, can the Gunslinger use their power? 
A No, supporting an exile is not a vote, and calling for exile is not a nomination.

=======
=Harpy=
=======
Q Deaths caused by the Harpy count as executions, right?
A No, the text says "dead", not "executed", so the day continues, unlike deaths caused by the Cerenovus.

Q Can the Harpy kills happen at night
A Yes.  The madness lasts until the next Harpy choice.

========
=Hatter=
========
Q If the Recluse misregisters, can they change character when the Hatter dies?
A Yes, but don't. This is unlikely to be fun, so recommended against. 

Q If the Hatter dies does can the evil Apprentice change their Minion ability?
A No, they are not a Minion so unaffected by the Hatter.

Q If the Hatter dies does can an evil Townsfolk (Bounty Hunter / Mezepheles / Cult Leader) or the evil Goon choose a new character?
A No, only Minions and Demons are affected by the Hatter.

Q Does a Minion or a Demon waking to make a choice after the Hatter dies register to the Chambermaid?
A No, it is not their own ability causing them to wake.

Q If the Hatter dies and the Minions change characters, can they have a new Damsel guess?
A No.

Q If the Hatter dies and a Minion or the Demon is drunk / poisoned, do they still change character?
A Yes, they become the drunk / poisoned role that they chose, as the change is due to the Hatter's ability, not their own.

Q How is the Hatter ability run? / When does the Hatter ability activate?
A The Hatter ability is immediate, similar to the Barber:
  * If the Hatter dies during the day, they use their ability before any other character.
  * If the Hatter dies at night, they use their ability immediately. The night order is only a reminder.

  Each Minion and Demon chooses their role, one after the other, knowing the previous choices.

Q What happens if the Hatter dies in a Legion game?
A Nothing, as per the jinx.

Q What happens if the Hatter dies in a non Legion game and an evil player picks Legion?
A All evil players become Legion, as per the jinx.

Q If Lil' Monsta kills the Hatter (and the variant rule is not being used),
  does the babysitting Minion choose from the Minions list, the Demons list, or either list?
A The babysitter chooses a different Demon to become or they can opt to remain as Lil' Monsta by picking a Minion.

Q What is the Hatter jinx with Lil' Monsta?
A If the Demon chooses Lil' Monsta then they also choose a Minion to become and babysit Lil' Monsta tonight.

Q Does a good Minion or Demon wake due to the Hatter dying?
A Yes.

Q How does the Hatter and Poppy Grower interact?
A The ST should probably wake the affected players separately.

Q If the Hatter dies on or after day five, can the Demon choose to become the Leviathan, instantly winning the game?
A No, as per the jinx.

=========
=Heretic=
=========
Q Does good wins ties rule apply before or after the Heretic's ability?
A The Heretic flips the winning team after the game has ended.
  So if two win conditions are satisfied at once,
  good wins on ties,
  which is then flipped by the Heretic causing evil to win.

  For example, in a final three of the Heretic, the Vortox and the Mayor the day ends without execution results in an evil win:
  No execution with three alive with both Vortox and Mayor in play means a good character win condition competing with an evil character win condition, so good wins.
  The Heretic ability is then applied, so evil wins.
 
Q The Fearmonger executes the good Lleech host in a Heretic game. Who wins?
A Abilities trump normal win conditions.
  So although the Demon died (good win) the Fearmonger win condition takes precedence (evil win), then the Heretic flips this to a good win.

Q In a final three of the Heretic, the Demon, and the Poisoner who is poisoning the Heretic, if the Poisoner is executed, does good win?
A Yes. The Poisoner being executed means the Heretic is no longer poisoned, and since the evil win condition is satisfied in a Heretic game, good wins.

Q If the Demon killed themselves in a Heretic game but the Heretic became drunk afterwards (but in the same night), would that be a Good win?
A No. The game would end instantly as the Demon dies; nothing would happen later in the night.
  The Heretic would have to be drunk/poisoned before the Demon dies.

Q The evil twinned Saint and the Heretic are in play. The Saint gets executed. Who wins?
A The Heretic applies last, so the Saint being executed (assuming they are the good Saint) would cause evil to win,
  then the Heretic flips it to a good win, unaffected by the Evil Twin. 
  This means that evil cannot win in a Heretic game so long as the twins are both alive.

Q Why are the Godfather and Heretic jinxed?
A The Godfather knows which Outsiders are in play.
  If they learnt that the Heretic is in play, they could tell the Demon to kill themselves, resulting in a free win for evil.

Q Why does the Baron have a possible +1 to Outsiders when the Heretic is on the script?
A Because otherwise in a base two Outsiders game with the Baron and only four Outsiders on the script, the evil team can know for sure that the Heretic is in play,
  and then the Demon can kill themselves and win.

Q If the Heretic is drunk or poisoned what happens?
A If the Heretic, regardless of living status, is drunk or poisoned when the game ends,
  then her ability does not function so the win conditions are not reversed.

Q What happens if there are two Heretic abilites in play, due to the Cannibal or the Philosopher?
A Two sober and healthy Heretic abilities would cancel each other out, making win conditions normal again.

Q Does an alive Philosopher Heretic drunking the actual Heretic cause win conditions to be flipped?
A Yes.  But should the Philosopher die, both Heretic abilities would then function, cancelling each other out.

Q Does the Cannibal or the Philosopher with an "even while dead" ability, such as the Heretic's, keep that ability when they die?
A Yes, they lose the Cannibal/Philosopher ability but keep their "even while dead" ability.


================
=High Priestess=
================
Q Can you show the HP themselves?
A Yes.

Q Can the HP only receive living players?
A No, you show them dead players too.

Q Who does the drunk / poisoned High Priestess see?
A Anyone.

Q Who does the High Priestess see in a Vortox game?
A The only restriction is that the ST does not give the one player that they would have given if it was not a Vortox game.
  It does not have to be the least helpful player to talk to.

==========
=Huntsman=
==========

Q Does the Huntsman actually change the outsider count? Or does it turn an already existing outsider into the Damsel?
A ST choice.
 
  Adding an Outsider does sound like a terrible Townsfolk ability, but it is a legal move.
  The players will not know for sure if the ST added the Damsel on top of the base Outsider count, but generally the Huntsman does not.
  The decision could depend on how weak or strong the good and evil characters that are in play.
  Players would likely prefer you swap an existing Outsider, as the other option is far too much of a downside for good and essentially removes two Townsfolk for nothing.

Q Could the Huntsman add the Damsel and then the Godfather or the Vigormortis remove it?
A No, the end result is an illegal setup.

Q In a base two Outsiders game, if both the Godfather and the Huntsman are in play,
  does the Huntsman modify the base two outsiders or can the Damsel be the +1 outsider added by the Godfather?
A With the Huntsman's ability, the ST:
   either changes a Townsfolk into the Damsel (so +1 Outsider), 
   or changes instead an existing Outsider into the Damsel (no change in the Outsider count).
  Note however that the Huntsman cannot add a second Damsel while there is already one in play.

  In a Huntsman Godfather game, the Outsider count could be anywhere between one and four in a base two Outsider game:
   1 Outsider: The Damsel. The Godfather removed an Outsider
   2 Outsiders: The Godfather removed an Outsider and the Huntsman changed a Townsfolk into the Damsel.
   3 Outsiders: The Damsel is already in play and the Godfather added an Outsider.
   4 Outsiders: Godfather added an Outsider and the Huntsman changed a Townsfolk into the Damsel.
  Probably some of them are unbalanced, but all of there are technically allowed.

Q If the Huntsman picks the Philosopher Damsel, does the Philo change?
A No.

Q Can the Huntsman transform the Cannibal that currently has the Damsel ability?
A No, they are not the Damsel.

=====
=Imp=
=====
Q When an Imp kills themself, and there are several minions alive, is there a priority order for who should become the new demon?
  And if a minion becomes the Demon, would the entire evil team be notified about the identity of the new Demon? 
A The Scarlet Woman must become the Demon if their ability is active (alive, not droisoned, 5+ alive players), as that is the entire point of their ability.
  Otherwise, it is the ST's choice which living Minion gets the Imp from the Imp's ability. 

  Only the new Imp is notified - the rest of the Evil 
  are not notified, but they will know that it happened since their Demon died.

Q If an Imp selfkills do they get to choose which Minion becomes the new Imp assuming there is no Scarlet Woman?
A No, that is the ST's choice.
  The evil team can of course inform the ST of a plan they have involving the starpass landing on a specific Minion,
  and the ST may choose to aid that plan, but the ST is not obligated to do so.
 
Q If the Imp kills the Mayor, and the Mayor bounces the kill back to the Imp, can the Imp starpass?
A Yes.

Q Can multiple Imps selfkill / starpass in one game? Can the Imp change more than once in the same game?
A Yes, it is part of the Imp's ability and is not a once per game action, unlike with the Fang Gu jump.
  
  The physical game comes with four Imp tokens, since (not including Recluse hijinks) that is how many Imps there could end up being.


===========
=Innkeeper=
===========
Q The Shabaloth picks the Innkeeper first, then one of the Innkeeper's picks second. Do both die or just the innkeeper?
  Also, is the Innkeeper drunk still drunk?
A The order of the choices matters and the characters die as they are chosen,
  so the Innkeeper dies the moment they are chosen and any protection and drunking they are the source of leaves the grim immediately.

==============
=Investigator=
==============
Q Since the Librarian can get a 'no' or a '0' in a game with no Outsiders, can the Spy in a single Minion game register as a Townsfolk to the Investigator,
  giving them a 'no' or a '0'?
A It is a legal move, if not necessarily a fun one.

Q Can the Investigator see the Recluse as a certain Minion?
A Yes, and this is a common occurrence.

Q Can the Librarian or Investigator ping on themselves? Such as when seeing a Drunk or Marionette respectively?
A The Librarian or Investigator player is "a player", so they can see themselves. 
  So it is a legal move, if not necessarily a good one.

=========
=Juggler=
=========
Q If the Juggler does not Juggle, do they still get a number?
A This can be ruled either way:
  * Some STs rule that even if they do not claim Juggler they can still get information.
  * Some STs rule that the "public" aspect of Juggler requires an actual claim in Town Square and no claim means no info.

  These are both legitimate rulings, and can make a difference in a Vortox game.

Q The Juggler dies giving the sufficiently mad Pixie her ability. 
  If the Pixie Juggler had juggled the day before she gained the ability, is she woken at night and given her info?
A No. She would have to juggle the day after getting her ability, her "first day", and then get her info the next night.

Q When does the Philosopher Juggler have to juggle to get their info?
A The day after they picked the Juggler ability.  They are then woken the following night to gain their info.

Q When the Juggler gets her info, is it the info at the moment she wakes? Or is it at the time she juggled?
A The info is tied to what was true at the time of the juggle; any role changes since the juggle are ignored.

Q If the Juggler is changed into something else by the Pit-Hag on the night she would have received her number, does she still receive info of her juggles? 
A No.

Q The Bone Collector picks the dead Juggler.  When does the Juggler need to juggle?
A They must juggle the day before they are bone collected (when they are still dead / have no ability)
  and then the night they are bone collected they get their info.

Q How does a dead Juggler that is resurrected (Professor / Al-Hadikhia / ...) work?
A She gets a completely fresh ability, so can she juggle the following day and get answers that night.

Q How does a Barista 2 Juggler work?
A The ST would have to decide how they would want that to work.

========
=Kazali=
========
Q What info is their to hide from the Kazali in a game with the Poppy Grower? 
A During demon info the Kazali is not told who their Minions are, even though they just picked them.
  They do learn their bluffs and any other relevant info to the Demon.
  The Minions are not told who the Kazali is but are informed of any other relevant information.
  
  Most of the time it is not that important as the Kazali can just gather the evil team together and get them up to speed,
  though it is more relevant if the Goon or the Soldier are on the script which can disrupt the Kazali's picks.

Q Can the ST give a new Minion’s previous role to the Kazali as a bluff?
A Yes, but that might be considered nerfing the power of the Kazali.

Q When the Kazali picks the Baron, are two extra Outsiders added?
A No, nothing happens.

Q What does the Kazali's [-? or +? Outsiders] setup modifier mean exactly? 
A It works as a wild card so that no matter what Minions the Kazali creates,
  and what number of Outsiders or Townsfolk are replaced, 
  the result will always be a valid setup.

  If the Kazali chose an Outsider, then their setup was [-1 Outsider]. 
  If an extra Outsider was added to the base count but then the Kazali chose none, their setup was [+1 Outsider].
  
  The players have to keep that in mind when the Outsider count is not aligning with what should be in play.

----------------------
Q What happens when the Kazali picks the Goon to be a Minion?
A The Goon becomes evil and the Minion the Kazali chose. 
  The Kazali is now drunk for the rest of N1 so any further Minion picks are ignored by the ST who decides the rest of the evil team herself.
  During Minion info, when the Kazali is told their true Minions, they will likely guess what happened.

Q Does the Goon become an evil Minion if they are chosen N1 by the Kazali?
A As per the jinx, the Goon becomes the chosen Minion, and any remaining Minions are chosen by the ST.
  
  During the Demon and Minion info stages the evil team will correctly learn each other as this is unaffected by the Goon.  This assumes there is no Poppy Grower in play.
----------------------

Q The Kazali cannot choose the King to become a Minion if the Choirboy is in play.
  How is this run, since the Demon does not yet know who the King is?
A If the King and Choirboy are both in play and the Kazali happens to randomly choose the King,
  the ST shakes their head no and forces them to choose again.
  If after all of their picks the King still exists, the Kazali is told who the King is.


======
=King=
======

Q Can "the King" for the Choirboy ability refer to any character with the King ability?
A No, the King only. Philosopher King, Drunk King, Marionette King, Cannibal King, Pixie King - none of these would count for the Choirboy ability.

Q Does the Demon learn the Drunk who believes that they are the King?
A No. The Drunk believing that they are the King is not the King.
  On the other hand, the King who N1 is drunk, or poisoned, does not alert the Demon until they are sober / healthy.

Q Does a newly created Demon learn who the King is?
A Yes. The King's ability, which is a constant check, says "the Demon knows" so new Demons learn who the King is.

Q Does the King include Travellers in the 'dead outnumber the living'?
A Yes. If they were were not, the ability would say so, like Scarlet Woman does.

=======
=Klutz=
=======
Q The Klutz gets nominated in a Riot game and dies. Do they have to pick someone before (optionally) nominating?
A Yes. Their countdown will restart if the game is continuing. So it would look like this:
  #  ST: <Klutz> dies. 3... 2...
  #  Klutz: I claim Klutz and pick x.
  #  ST: The game continues. 3... 2...


========
=Legion=
========
Q In a Legion game, what can the Investigator see?  Can they see a Legion token?
A The Investigator would not see a Legion token, as that is a Demon token.
  They would see the token of a Minion from the script.
  Each Legion can register as a Minion, as well a a Demon, so the Investigator / Undertaker / .. 
  can see a Minion token instead of a Legion,
  which is recommended given that the ST typically wants to help Legion deceive town as to whether Legion is in play. 

Q Legion do not know other Legions, right?
A Legion learn other Demons/Minions like normal.

Q All alive Legion can potential kill one person, right?
A Yes, though Legion should usually never kill more than two, and if they do multikill it should be multiple Legions.
  Multikill is usually done to support a world pushed by the Legions so it balances out
  for example, if a Legion is bluffing Gossip and asks the ST to kill an extra player tonight, the ST will typically comply and kill one more legion.

Q Does the Juggler juggling a Legion as a Minion always get a 1?
A No, the Legion player can register as a specific Minion that is not the one juggled.

Q Can the Clockmaker get a 0 in a Legion game?
A No, they should get the number between two closest Legion, which is usually a 1.

Q Do Legions learn each other in a Teensyville game?
A No.

Q Can the drunk Investigator learn of a Legion who is not in play?
A No, the Investigator can never see Legion; Legion registers as a Minion, but the Legion character is not a Minion character.

  In a Legion game, the Investigator would see a Legion as any Minion.



===========
=Leviathan=
===========
Q Can the Leviathen kill at night?
A No, that is not part of their ability.

Q The Pit Hag creates a Leviathan and the ST kills the old Leviathan.
  If a good player has already been executed, would executing the good Leviathan lose the game for the good team or win it?
  Does the "two good executions" counter reset?
A The Pit Hag cannot turn someone into a character that is in play so this cannot happen.
  Any individual Leviathan does have its own good player executed counter though, if it was not alive and sober to see an execution, it did not count to them.
  
Q With the Leviathan, if the Recluse is the second good player to be executed can they register as evil to continue the game,
  then later change how they register to make evil win at any time?
A No, it is only looked at at the time of execution.

Q Can the Recluse register as evil so that their death not count towards the Leviathan's win condition?
A Yes.

Q The Choirboy is useless in a Leviathan game or is there a special rule like with the Ravenkeeper, the Sage, etc.?
A There is no jinx.
  The King is also usually useless with the Leviathan because the dead will not outnumber the living unless there are a lot of other killing roles.

Q If the Leviathan and the Scarlet Woman are in play, and the Leviathan is executed on day five, does the SW become the Demon, thus causing evil to win?
  Or does the SW ability not work, as if there were fewer than five alive?
  Or is it a new instance of the Leviathan ability, giving good five more days?
A The SW catches the demonhood and the games ends with an evil win.
  The day count is universal and does not reset.

Q Is a Pit-Hag making a Leviathan after day 5 an automatic win for evil?
A No, there is a jinx preventing the PH from creating the Levi after day 5.

Q D1 a good player is executed. N2 the Courtier poisons the Leviathan and the next day the Courtier is executed. Does the game end immediately?
A No. The Leviathan was drunk when the Courtier was executed, so they did not see the second execution.

Q The Widow poisons the Leviathan permanently. During the first four days, town executes 2+ good players. On day 5, the Widow is executed.
  Does the Sober Leviathan need to see two more good players executed, or does evil win after the Widow is executed?
A The poisoned Leviathan did not "see" any good executions so when she becomes healthy her count is at zero,
  but the healthy and sober Leviathan does win the game because day 5 is over.

Q Can the Leviathan win the game as a regular Demon wincon?
  where there are lots of nightkilling characters in the script, and the Leviathan stays alive with only one remaining alive player?
A Yes, evil's normal win condition of two players alive always applies and ends the game.

Q If the Leviathan gets drunk or poisioned, do the days reset?
A No, the days are universal.  However, any good executions while the Leviathan is droisoned do not count towards their win condition.

=============
=Lil' Monsta=
=============
Q The Lunatic, the Marionette and the King are all "the Demon knows who you are" abilities.  How does this work in a Lil' Monsta game?
A Each time the player holding Lil' Monsta changes they become "the Demon" and, the first time they become the babysitter, they are told who those characters are.

  If the Marionette babysits Lil' Monsta, while they still learn the Lunatic and the King,
  they do not learn that they are the Marionette because of the Marionette jinx with Lil' Monsta.

  If the Lunatic is for real given Lil' Monsta (as opposed to the ST simulating this)
  then, as well as learning that they are the babysitter and being shown the King and the Marionette,
  they learn that they are their own Lunatic,
  and are told their own Lunatic choices, because the real Demon learns the Lunatic's choices. 

Q Is a good player holding Lil' Monsta informed that they are the babysitter?
A Yes.

Q If the babysitter dies in a Lil' Monsta game that continues (Mastermind / Evil Twin), do the Minions get to choose a new babysitter?
A No, if the babysitter dies so does Lil' Monsta, so the ability cannot continue.

Q Does the Alchemist wake up with the Minions to decide who babysits Lil' Monsta?
A No, the Alchemist is not a Minion, they merely have the ability of an out of play one.

Q Do dead Minions get woken up to decide who babysits Lil' Monsta?
A Yes.

Q How is Lil' Monsta affected by the Minstrel triggering?
A Lil’ Monsta is not affected by the Minstrel; it can kill and change babysitters, even though the Minions are drunk.

Q Can other killing roles add on to Lil' Monsta's kill?
  Or does LM's ability 'a player dies each night' mean only one player can die each night?
A There can be extra kills due to other abilities on top of Lil' Monsta's kill.

Q In a Lil' Monsta game can there be no deaths at night?
  Perhaps because a player was protected (Innkeeper / Soldier / Monk / ...)
  or sinking a kill to simulate a Mastermind day.
A Yes.

---
Q If the Courtier drunks Lil' Monsta, do the Minions still vote but just no kills happen?
A (caveat: There is no write up)
  The Lil' Monsta is drunk, and cannot move or kill for three days.
  The Minions do not wake to vote in this ruling.
  (The waking of the Minions is a mechanical effect by another ability and poisoned mechanical things cannot happen.)
  The LM would just be on the same person it was last put on.
  The ST does not wake the Minions to deceive them that they are working normally as no player is LM.

Q If the Courtier drunks Lil' Monsta, what happens?
A For three nights, the Minions do not wake to choose who holds Lil' Monsta and nobody dies due to LM.
  If the player babysitting a drunk LM dies, then good wins. 
  Only the LM themselves is drunk, the player holding the LM is not and can therefore still use their ability.
--
Q What happens in a Lil' Monsta game on a Minstrel day?
A There are no deaths and the Minions do not wake together.

Q If the Good Twin is holding Lil' Monsta and is executed with the Evil Twin alive, which team wins?
A Evil. Because character abilities trump normal game win conditions, except in some situations, including some where LM is involved ...

Q If the Exorcist picks the player holding Lil' Monsta what happens?
A The Exorcist only ever stops the Demon, if selected, waking up to use their own ability,
  but Lil' Monsta never wakes in order to kill so if the babysitter is selected the LM kill still goes through.
  However, as the babysitter is registering as "the Demon", they do not wake to use their own ability.
  In LM games the Exorcist is essentially a really bad Preacher.

Q If the good Saint is holding Lil' Monsta and is executed, which team wins?
A Good, because in a tie good wins.

Q If a player holding Lil' Monsta "Barber swaps" herself with a different player, does the Lil' Monsta token stay where it is or does it follow the swap?
A (Standard caveat: there is no write up for Lil' Monsta)
  Best guess: since the Barber only swaps characters, and no player is Lil' Monsta, the Lil Monsta token likely stays put.

Q If a Townsfolk is given Lil' Monsta do they get told?
A Yes, they get woken and told that they are holding Lil' Monsta and, as applicable, learns the King, Lunatic and Marionette.
  Except when the Marionette holds LM as they do not learn that they are the Marionette.

Q Would a good Minion (perhaps caused by a Pit-Hag or Barber swap) learn who all the other Minions are in a Lil Monsta game?
A Yes. You could prevent it with a house rule that only evil Minions wake.

Q What happens if the public Goblin holding Lil' Monsta is executed?
A Good wins, as it would be impossible for good to win otherwise.

Q Can the Scarlet Woman holding the Lil' Monster Barber swap with the previous Minion that was holding the Lil' Monsta?
A Yes.

Q Does the Minion with Lil' Monster register as LM or that Minion or both, to a Dreamer for example?
A To a Dreamer just their true role, they are the Demon but they are still their role, they will never be seen as LM for any abilities that detect character.

Q If the Gambler gambles a player as Lil' Monsta, does she die everytime?
A Yes, a player is never LM.

Q Can the Soldier hold Lil' Monsta?
  Or is being the Demon considered a negative effect?
A The Soldier can hold LM.

Q Does the Preacher affect Lil' Monsta because a Minion most of the time holds the baby.
A The Preacher stops the Minion's ability but not LM's ability to kill and move around.
  "Lil’ Monsta: A Minion who is selected by the Preacher while holding the Lil’ Monsta token loses their Minion ability, but retains their Lil’ Monsta Demon ability."

Q Can Travellers hold Lil' Monsta?
A Yes.

Q In a Teensyville Lil' Monsta game, do the Minions learn each other?
A Yes. The Lil' Monsta ability allows them to learn each other, but not until they wake up together to choose who holds LM as the normal Minion info step is skipped. 


Q Does a Lil' Monsta Lunatic work? Would the Lunatic think they are a Minion?
A No, you will need another demon on the script for the Lunatic to think they are.

Q If the Exorcist picks the Minion holding Lil' Monsta, does the Minion still get their ability, or any player holding it for that matter?
A Unknown.

Q Does the player holding the Lil' Monsta token register as the Demon to the Flowergirl?
A Yes. The Flowergirl looks back so would learn if the player holding the token in the day voted even if the token moved that night.

Q Is the Scarlet Woman’s ability "reusable” in a Lil' Monsta game?
A Yes, probably, but there is no official LM write up yet so who knows?


========
=Lleech=
========
Q If the Lleech poisons his Marionette/Lunatic on N1, does he still learn that that player is his Marionette/Lunatic?
A Yes, he will have already learned that player before he picked his host.

Q If the Lleech hosts the Poppy Grower, the Poppy Grower then dies, but the Lleech is caught by a Scarlet Woman,
  would the evil team learn each other?
  In other words, does the Lleech's host die poisoned?
A The Lleech host dies poisoned.

Q The Soldier is immune to the Demon, so can they be the Lleech host?
A Yes. "Immune" is not really the right word to use.  The Soldier is safe from harmful effects.
  Dying, being poisoned, and turning evil are examples of harmful effects.
  Being the Lleech host is not a harmful effect, because when the host dies so does the Demon,
  and that benefits the good team.

  So the Soldier is not poisoned by the Lleech, but they are still their host.

Q Can the Lleech host be a Traveller?
A Yes. Though if the Traveller host is exiled, they die, so the Lleech dies too.
  Travellers rarely make for good hosts, but they mechanically can be.

Q There is a Lleech. The Pit-Hag creates a second demon. What happens?
A If the ST wants the Lleech to die, they must also kill the host.
  If that is not a reasonable option, then they can kill the newly created Demon instead.
  Deaths are arbitrary, so the ST should pick whichever option makes the most sense for that particular game at that particular moment.
﻿
Q What is the ruling for the Lleech being drunked, for example by the Sailor?
  Do they die when executed or not?
  Do they die when their host is executed?
  When does the Lleech dies if the Lleech was drunk when the host is executed?
A If the Lleech is drunk:
  - they die when executed
  - they do not die when the host dies
  - they become immortal if the second point happens even when they become sober again 
  Unless you run the recommended ruling that Lleech dies even if drunk when the host dies.

Q Does the Lleech host protected by the Monk become unpoisoned? 
A For that night, yes.

Q If the Monk protects the Lleech, is the Lleech prevented from dying with their host tonight?
A Yes, but as per the drunk/poisoned Lleech host dying rule you should probably have the Lleech die despite the protection.

Q What happens if the Lleech host is executed, and the Lleech dies,
  but then the Scarlet Woman becomes a new Lleech that selects as their host a player that is protected by the Monk?
A The host is sober as long as they are Monk protected, but they are still the host as usual.

Q Can the Lleech host herself?
A Yes.

Q If the Lleech is in play and the Pit-Hag makes a new demon, is the host now healthy?
A It depends on what happens. 
  If the Pit-Hag changes the Lleech into a different Demon, yes, the host is healthy.
  If the Pit-Hag makes someone else a Demon, then the ST can choose to kill the host (and thus the Lleech as well)
  in which case they will be healthy, but also dead.
  Or they could choose to leave the Lleech and host alive, so the host would still be poisoned in that case.

Q If the Lleech makes it to final three, is that an instant evil win?  Surely if the host was executed, that would create a final two before the Lleech dies.
A The Lleech and the host die simultaneously.

Q If a new Lleech is made (Scarlet Woman / Pit-Hag / Engineer / Hatter / ...) when do they select a host?
A A new Lleech chooses their host as soon as possible, then follows that by choosing a kill. 

Q In a final five that includes the Lleech, their host and the Scarlet Woman, the host is executed and dies, so the Lleech dies, does the SW become the Lleech?
A RAW the SW becomes the Lleech but STs sometimes run it otherwise to avoid situations where good cannot win.
  If the SW is allowed to become the Lleech in a final three then it is almost certainly a loss for the good team.
  One solution is to not allow the SW a kill that night.
  The Shabaloth and SW present a similar interaction.

=========
=Lunatic=
=========
Q Can you tell the Lunatic that they have been snake charmed?
A No, because the Lunatic's ability is that they think that they _are_ the Demon, not that they _were_ the Demon.
  If they are told that they are the good Snake Charmer then they are no longer being deceived that they are the Demon.

Q Does a droisoned Lunatic's pick(s) get shown to the Demon?
A No.

Q If the Courtier drinks with the Lunatic, does the Lunatic still believe that they are the Demon?
A Yes. The Lunatic will have pulled their Demon token out of the bag and learned fake info before the Courtier would be able to drink with them.

  While the Lunatic is drunk (by Courtier or otherwise)
  the ST treats them like the Demon that they think they are, waking them up to get their choices
  but the actual Demon is not informed of their picks.

Q If the Courtier drinks with the Lunatic on day one, would the Demon learn of the Lunatic?
A Yes.
  On night one, both the Lunatic waking to learn their fake information and the Demon waking to learn their real information happens before the Courtier acts.

  However, if a droisoned player is turned into the Lunatic, the Demon would not learn about them until the Lunatic is sober/healthy,
  When the new Lunatic does become sober/healthy the Demon would be informed as soon as possible.

Q Does the Lunatic have to think they are an EVIL demon?
A No, if it is believable that there is a troll Pit-Hag in the game, and someone becomes the Lunatic on a later night, you could reasonably go for good demon.
  However, the starting Lunatic needs to think they are the evil demon character because there is almost no way anything else could happen.
  It would need a skilled ST to convince the Lunatic that an Amnesiac ability put a good demon in the bag.
  
Q How does the Lunatic interact with the Ojo?  Does the Demon learn the character that the Lunatic-Ojo picks?
  What if the character is out-of-play?
A "The Demon learns who the player a Lunatic-Ojo functionally targetted, not the character chosen."
  So the Demon learns the player.  In the case of an of play character, the Demon learns who the ST picked.

Q Does the Demon learn the Lunatic in Teensyville?
A Yes, that is a function of the Lunatic ability,
  and all character abilities function normally in a game with five or six players.

Q The Lleech picks the Lunatic N1.  Does the Lleech learn who the Lunatic picks at night?
A No, the Lunatic is poisoned.

Q If the Lunatic thinks that they are the Lleech, does the demon learn who they picked N1?
A Yes.
  The Lunatic ability reads "and who you choose at night", so the demon learns who they picked. 
  But the Demon does not learn why they picked,
  so if the Pukka and the Lleech are on the script, then the Demon would not know which token the Lunatic saw, which might cause issues on N2 when deciding who to kill.

Q Can the Lunatic be told that another player is the Lunatic?
A Yes, but this can lead to the ST controlling the kills:
  * the ST chooses a kill for the fake Lunatic and informs the Lunatic, 
  * the Lunatic attacks the fake Lunatic's target to keep up the lie,
  * the Demon attacks the same target to keep up the lie.

  The ST can do this if their group is cool with the idea
  or perhaps to ensure seeing the Lunatic token does not confirm someone as the Demon.

  How to simulate the Lunatic to the Lunatic without dictating the kills:
  * have the Lunatic think that they are, for example, the Po
  * the actual Demon is the Pukka, and is shown to the Lunatic as their fake Lunatic (Demons never know what Demon their Lunatic thinks they are)
  * N1, the Pukka (actual Demon) picks player X
  * N2, the ST tells the Lunatic that their Lunatic (actual Demon) just tried to kill player X
  * and so on. Because the Pukka kills out of sync, the issue is solved.

-----combine
Q If the Lunatic thinks that they are the Fang Gu and the Fang Gu jumps to them, what are they told?
A They woken and told that they are the Fang Gu and are evil.

  Their character and alignment changed, and they no longer have the Lunatic ability that allows the ST to lie about it.
﻿
Q If the Lunatic-Fang Gu is Fang Gu-jumped, is she told that she is now evil?
A The ST informs the new Demon of their character and alignment as it changed and they no longer have the Lunatic ability.

Q If the Fang Gu jumps into the Lunatic who sees himself as the Fang Gu, does the ST still tell the Lunatic again that he is the Fang Gu?
A Yes. Players learn when their character and alignment have changed, 
  and the Lunatic will be a real Fang Gu meaning they no longer any character ability that allows some deception with that anymore. 
  They are actually changing character and alignment even though it is to what they may have already thought.

  So the ST would wake them up and inform tell them "You are the Fang Gu, you are evil." 
----

Q The Lunatic is good but believes they are an evil Demon.
  If the Pit-Hag turns the Lunatic into a Demon, will the Lunatic learn, along with their new role, that they are actually good?
 
A No, they do not learn their alignment because their alignment has not changed.

  When the Lunatic is Pit-Hagged into a Demon, they only have to be told their new role.
  They were good and are still good, so their alignment has not changed.
  If it is a new player, it might be helpful for the ST to tell them their alignment, but for experienced players this is not necessary.
  If the Lunatic actually turned evil due to a Fang Gu jump then they would learn they are now evil.

  In general, players only learn when their alignment changes, and if a player were to enquire about their alignment should be told something like "your alignment has not changed".

  A similar scenario to the pithagged Lunatic is the Marionette who when catching a star pass is not informed they are evil because their alignment has not changed.

Q If the Lunatic is Pit-Hagged into the Demon she already thinks she is, what is she told?
A You reinform the new Demon of her character, as it changed and she no longer has the Lunatic ability.

Q If the Lunatic is Pit-Hagged into another role, they are told their new role, but are they told that they are in fact good?
A No, their role has changed, but not their alignment, and players should only be informed of their alignment when it changes.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns a player into the Lunatic, does the ST tell that player that they are evil?
A No.  The Lunatic's ability is "You think you are a Demon, but you are not. The Demon knows who you are and who you choose at night.".
  With Pit-Hag on script it is very believable someone could be made a good demon, and that is all that is required of the Lunatic, to believe they are a demon of some kind.

Q What happens if the Exorcist picks the Lunatic in BMR?
A Nothing. You can deceive the Lunatic into thinking the Exorcist picked them in any game with or without an Exorcist in play.

Q Can the ST fake the Poppy Grower is in play and not show fake Minions to the Lunatic?
A Yes.

  The ST is already lying to the player that they are the Demon,
  so they can lie about them being affected by the Poppy Grower, even when they are not in the game.

  Anything on the script that could happen or be told to the Demon can be simulated for the Lunatic: fake Magician, fake King, fake Marionette, fake Exorcist, ...

Q Can the ST make the Lunatic who has figured out what they are believe that they have been Fang Gu jumped?
A Yes.

Q The Pit-Hag changes a player into the Lunatic. Would it be valid to first wake them, tell them they are an Outsider of some type, 
  put them to sleep and pretend to continue with the night order, then wake them telling them they were Fang Gu jumped?
A No, their ability does not make them think that they are an Outsider.

Q If the Lunatic who thinks they are the Ojo picks an out of play character, what is the Demon shown?
A Nothing. 

  The Lunatic says the Demon learns who they picked, and the Ojo says picking an out of play character is the ST's choice not the player's, so the Lunatic Ojo did not pick anyone.

Q If the Hatter dies, can the Lunatic be given the choice to change characters?
A Yes, this does not even need the actual Hatter to die.


=============
=Lycanthrope=
=============
Q What happens when the Lycanthrope successfully kills a good player in an Al-Hadikhia game?
A No-one can die to the Al-Hadikhia regardless of their live/die choices but players can still be resurrected.

Q If the Lycanthrope chooses a good player and a Godfather chooses to use their ability, does the Godfather ability get wasted?
A The Godfather does not choose when they use it,
  but the Godfather kill also does not go through when the Lycan picks a good player.
  This is unlike the Assassin, which kills despite the Lycan protection.

Q The Lycanthrope attacks a good player, then the Pit-Hag creates a new Demon.  How many deaths can occur that night?
A The Pit-Hag acts first in the night order so deaths are completely arbitrary which can include blocking the Lycanthrope kill.

Q If the Lycanthrope attacks a good player who does not die (sober Soldier / Tea Lady protection / Innkeeper protection / unspent Fool / ...)
  is it a no death night?
A If the Lycanthrope attacks a good player but that good player does not die, players can still die tonight due to other characters’ abilities.

Q If the Lycanthrope chooses the Mayor and the Mayor redirects the kill to an evil player, RAW, could you kill the evil player?
A No, a Mayor bounce does not change the nature of the kill attempt's source. It is still a Lycanthrope ability doing it and it has to fail.

Q Can the Lycanthrope kill the Lleech host, ending the game?
A Yes, assuming the Lleech chose a good player as their host (Lleeches do occasionally pick Minions).

Q How does Pukka interact with the Lycanthrope?
  If the Lycan prevents the death of a Pukka poisoned target, do they remain poisoned? 
  Or, in other words, does a Pukka chosen target have to die in order to become healthy?
A No, the Lycan-protected and Pukka-poisoned player becomes a healthy (and living) player.

  The order of events would look something like this:
  *N1 - The Pukka poisons player A.
  *N2 - The Lycanthrope kills a good player and the Pukka chooses player B. 
        Player B is poisoned and player A becomes healthy and does not die since the Lycanthrope ability worked successfully.

Q What is the Gambler jinx with the Lycanthrope?
A If the Gambler gambles someone incorrectly and dies while there is an alive Lycan ability,
  they are the only player who can die that night, just like if the Lycan chose them.
  
  * the alignment of the Lycan's pick is irrelevant
  * no other deaths due to other abilities go through, which includes the Lycan's and the Demon's picks
  * whether the Lycan is drunk or poisoned is RAW irrelevant


==========
=Magician=
==========
Q If the Magician ability comes into play after N1, do Demons and Minions learn information on the player with the Magician ability? 
  (Excluding Poppy Grower circumstances) 
A No. They learn it during the info phase, and that phase has already passed, so they learn nothing.

Q If the Philosopher drunks the Magician N1, does the actual Magician’s ability happen when the Philo dies?
  Does Demon and Minion info happen again midway through the game?
A No, because by that time the deception has already failed. 
  Similarly, a Pit-Hag creating a Magician midgame would not cause the Minions and Demon to redo their info steps.

--------------------rewrite
Q Does the Demon immediately know who one of her Minions is if the Marionette and the Magician are in the same game? Can the Demon think the Magician is their Marionette?
A When the Magician and the Marionette are in the game together, the Demon will learn one Minion as her Marionette and the rest as non-Marionette Minions.
  She will immediately figure out the Magician is in the game,
  but if the Magician is sat next to the Demon or the Recluse then the Demon can be told the Magician is her Marionette,
  so learning the Marionette does not immediately mean the Demon knows for sure who one of her Minions is.

Q In a one minion game, with the Marionette and the Magician in play, does the Demon just learn both players without learning one is the Marionette?
A They would learn both as Minions, and learn the Marionette as the Marionette,
  but they would not know for sure if their Marionette was actually the Magician and the other Minion was a non-Marionette.

  The Magician's ability is that the Demon thinks they are a Minion, and that can include a specific Minion if relevant
  similar to how the Lunatic can be lied to about different things in order to keep up the ruse that they are the Demon.

  If the Magician was in the game and the Minion was not the Marionette, 
  then, if the Magician was sat next to the Demon or the Recluse, the Demon could learn the Magician as the Marionette.
-----------------------------

============
=Marionette=
============
Q Can the Marionette be shown a fake Nightwatchman ping?
A General consensus is no, because deceiving them about that is not part of the Marionette "think" ability.
  
  Unlike for example telling a Lunatic that they were Exorcised, which is part of them being a Demon.

Q Do the other Minions learn the Marionette in a Lil' Monsta game?
A Anyone, except the Marionette (jinx), who babysits learns the Marionette.

Q Does the Demon learn the Marionette in Teensyville games?
A Yes, that is a function of the Marionette ability, and all character abilities function normally in a game with five or six players.

  The Marionette is the only Minion the Demon will learn in a Teensyville, unless the Toymaker fabled is in play.

Q If the evil Marionette is Pit-Hagged into another role, are they informed that they are evil?
A No.  RAW players only learn when their alignment changes, and the Marionette's alignment has not changed.

Q Can the Marionette think that she is an Outsider?
A Yes.

Q After the Hatter dies, is the Marionette woken and given a choice?
A Yes. This hard confirms to them that they are the Marionette, similar to if the Preacher picks them.

Q If the Marionette-Artist asks if they are the Marionette, can the ST answer 'yes'?
A Yes.

Q Can the Pit-Hag or the Barber make the good Marionette ,
  or does the Marionette ability, which says "You think you are a good character, but you are not.", override this?
A Yes they can make a good Marionette.
  If the player targeted was previously a Townsfolk or Outsider the ST does not even need to tell them anything.
  Effectively the player has become like the Drunk.

Q If the Marionette is turned into the Demon, are they notified of an alignment change?
A Their alignment has not actually changed, so no, the ST does not have to notify them of anything.
  They could verify for the player that they are evil if they wanted to, but it is by no means required.

  If they ask directly what their alignment is, an ST can answer with either,
  "You are evil," or "You have not been informed of an alignment change."

  For newer players who are confused it may be best to clarify that they are evil,
  whereas the latter response could be given to more experienced players who know how the Marionette works. 

Q Does a Marionette Townsfolk receive misinformation?
A The Marionette is not actually a Townsfolk, and so is not affected by the Vortox.
  They are not drunk or poisioned, but can be given any information, good or bad,
  in order to deceive them in to thinking that they are the Townsfolk character that they saw.
  The ST can treat them as if they were drunk, but they are not.

Q Could the Marionette believe that she is the Atheist?
A Yes, though it might require an alternate setup to make that happen.

Q In a 13+ player game, there are three Minions. If one Minion is going to be the Marionette, only two Minion tokens are put in the bag.
  If once the roles are given out both Minion tokens are drawn by the two players neighboring the Demon, 
  what can the ST do?
A Options are:
    # Change a player to a Minion,
    # seat the Marionette next to the Reluse if there is one,
    # scrap the Marionette from the game and instead change a good player into the remaining Minion (but remember to still respect character type counts),
    # rerack.

  To avoid this situation from happening, you can, when putting the tokens into the bag,
  instead deal only two Minions and no Demon, then choose two adjacent players who drew good tokens to instead be the Demon and Marionette,
  though some players dislike this as it amounts to the ST assigning characters rather than letting the tokens draw as they may.
  If you do this, remember to give the Demon the character they initally drew as a bluff, so that they are not getting a fourth bluff for free.

Q Can the Marionette in setup be placed next to the Recluse, and not the Demon?
A Yes.
  And it is a N1 +1 to the Mathematician too.

Q The Marionette thinks they are the Klutz. Is the Klutz in-play?
A No, the Klutz is not in play.

Q The Marionette is swapped to something else, they are no longer the Marionette;
  ergo they no longer are under the purview of "believing they are a good Townsfolk" despite being evil.
  Since their new role does not specify that they believe themselves to be good, does their alignment needs to be clarified?
A No. The only rule about learning alignment is when it actually changes, which has never happened in this scenario.

Q If an Outsider is made into the Marionette,
  which would make one less Outsider in the game than it is supposed to be,
  is it still a legal setup?
A Yes. In this scenario the Marionette has acted like a soft -1 Outsider modifier.

Q If a Demon comes into play does the new Demon learn who the Marionette is?
A The Demon must always know who the Marionette is, while the Marionette is in play, 
  as the ability says the Demon knows who you are, like an "always" clause.

  If the demon ever changes 
  (Fang Gu jump, Lil Monsta swaps babysitter, Imp starpasses, Snake Charmer correctly guesses, Pit-Hag creates a new Demon, Barber swap occurs, etc),
  then the new Demon must be told who the Marionette is. 
  If the Demon ever changes back to the original player, they are not told again.
  This same exact thing applies to the King and the Lunatic.

Q Do the other Minions learn of the Marionette?
A No, they are told one fewer Minion. 
  The other Minions will need figure out that that means there is a Marionette in the game on their own, and go talk to their Demon.

Q The Marionette has a special case for when the Preacher picks them that their ability stops working and
  the ST pretty much ignores them at night since thinking they are a good player is their ability.
A Correct.

Q Can the Marionette Damsel be woken up and told that they became a Townsfolk when there is no Huntsman in the game?
A Yes.

Q Can the Marionette Choirboy be woken up and told the Demon when there is no King in the game?
A Yes, but getting that setup is tricky as the Choirboy requires the King and you do not know at setup that they will be the Marionette.

Q Is the Marionette informed that they have been preached? Do they cease to wake if they believed they were a waking character? Are they told that they are the Marionette?
A The Marionette who is selected by the Preacher will wake and learn that this has happened.
  They no longer have anything that makes them "think they are a good character", and will no longer be woken at night to use an ability.
  They will not explicitly be told that they are evil or the Marionette, but will probably be able to figure it out.

Q What happens if a player chooses the Marionette with the Hatter ability?
A The ST informs that player that they are a good character and tells the Demon who their Marionette is.


============
=Mastermind=
============
Q If the Demon is executed and the following day the Apprentice Mastermind is exiled, does good win?
A Yes.

Q On a Mastermind day after the Demon is killed, when either the Spy or the Recluse is executed, is the winner completely up to the ST?
A Mechanically, the ST can make either team lose if either a Spy or Recluse is executed via misregistration.
  But the recommendation is not to have any misregistering on a Mastermind day;
  killing the Recluse would be an evil win, and killing the Spy would be a good win.

  Fearmonger and Mastermind do not play well with the misregistration abilities
  because if the ST uses the misregistration abilities players will feel like the ST entirely decided which team won.

Q If the Demon is executed and dies in F3 with the Mastermind and one good player still alive, does the game continue into a F2 day?
A Yes.
  The Mastermind's ability is to "play for 1 more day", and character abilities override normal game rules.
  A F2 day with Mastermind and a "dead" Zombuul is also a typical situation so the players will need to figure out what happened.

Q If there is a Mastermind ability in play and the Demon is executed ending the game, a Mastermind day triggers.
  If a new demon is created or some other mechanic would allow the game to otherwise continue after the Mastermind day has triggered, does the Mastermind day continue?
A The Mastermind's ability is still in effect even though the game can now continue without it:
  If no one is executed the game would continue but if someone is executed that player loses

  If, upon the execution of a Demon, causing there to be a ‘Mastermind day’, 
  another Demon comes into play, or another character that causes the game to continue comes into play, 
  the game can continue beyond the ‘Mastermind day’, 
  however the Mastermind ability still functions upon an execution on said ‘Mastermind day’. 

  If the Demon is executed, causing the Mastermind ability to function and cause a proceeding ‘Mastermind day’,
  then another Demon comes into play, an execution will end the game, with the team of the player being executed losing.

  An Evil Twin being brought into play would allow the evil team to win upon the execution of a good player on a ‘Mastermind day’,
  however if an evil player were executed (or no execution occurred) on said ‘Mastermind day’
  then the game would continue with the Evil Twin ability needing to be resolved 

Q Does the Mastermind trigger after the Zombuul dies for a second time?
A Yes. This is the only time the MM does trigger with the Zombuul.

Q On a Mastermind day, if the Politician was nominated and determined to have done enough to flip, would evil win or would good win?
  i.e. does the Politician alignment change happen after the Mastermind had resolved the game?
A The Politician flips after the game ends, so evil wins.

Q If the Demon is killed by another way than execution, such as to the Gunslinger, the Mastermind cannot use its ability, right?
A Correct.

===============
=Mathematician=
===============
Q After the Pit-Hag creates a demon and deaths are arbitrary, is the Demon's kill being blocked a +1 to the Mathematician?
A Yes.

Q Does the Assassin bypassing an ability like the Fool's, the Sailor's, or the Tea Lady's protection give a +1 to the Mathematician?
A Yes, the Assassin's ability is causing another player's protection ability to work abnormally.

Q If the Al-Hadikhia chooses the Soldier, the sober Sailor, and the Tea Lady protected player, and they all choose death, would that register as a six for the Mathematician?
A The Mathematician only count the Demon's ability as working abnormally and would get a one,
  as it is the number of abilities that work abnormally, not how many times they were abnormal.

Q What is the interaction between the Mathematician and the Magician?
  Does the Mathematician pick up on the Demons' and Minions' abilities "not working properly", as it does whenever the Spy or the Recluse interacts with a character?
A No, because Mathematician counts how many abilities worked wrongly,
  and Demon and Minion info is not happening due to their character abilities, rather due to their character type and game rules.

  Although, interestingly, in a game with the Poppy Grower and the Magician,
  the Poppy Grower dying and giving the Demon and Minions their info is considered part of the Poppy Grower ability,
  meaning that the Mathematician would detect if the Magician ability caused the Demon and Minions to learn an extra player from the Poppy Grower ability.

Q Does the Exorcist preventing the Demon from waking up lead to a +1 for the Mathematician?
A Yes, the Demon's ability is working abnormally due to the Exorcist.

Q How do Pit-Hag arbitrary deaths register to the Mathematician?
A The Pit-Hag’s arbitrary death ability allows the ST to kill any player and protect any player from death.
  So if the Demon's target does not die due to the PH allowing the ST to protect that player, 
  that is +1 to the Mathematician (place an abnormal token on the Demon). 
  If the ST uses the Pit-Hag’s ability to kill additional players,
  then that is the PH's ability functioning normally,
  so that is not a +1 to the Mathematician.

Q If the Philosopher picks an ability while poisoned,
  do they register a single abnormality to the Mathematician and then never again,
  or do they register an abnormality each time they think they use their ability and it functions improperly? 
A They would ping the Mathematician every time they attempted to use the ability they think they gained and it produces a wrong result,
  because the ST is only able to do that while the Philosopher is continuously drunk or poisoned,
  so sit is still due to another character's ability that such deception is even possible.

Q If a new Mathematician is created (Pit-Hag, Barber swapped, ...) 
  would they read the "abnormal" tokens placed the previous day,
  or does the new ability instance mean they only "see" malfunctionings that happen after they entered play?
A They would see all abnormalities from the day.

Q If a player has incorrect information due to the Spy or the Recluse, does that register as an ability working abnormally to the Mathematician?
A Yes.

Q If the Juggler juggles but the next night she is turned by the Pit-Hag, she does not her info. Does this register to the Mathematician?
A No. Her ability did not function abnormally at any point; which ability she had simply changed.

----
Q Does a drunk Devil's Advocate ping the Mathematician?
A If their target is executed and dies, then it is +1 to the Mathematician.

Q If the Devil's Advocate ability did not work properly, does that register to the Mathematician as an abnormality,
  or only if that player dies?
A It would only be an abnormality if the player was executed and died.
---

Q The Cannibal eats the Drunk. Does that count to the Mathematician?
A No, the Cannibal is working as intended.

Q Does the Cannibal who ate a Minion register as a misfunction to the Mathematician?
A No, it is their own ability that poisons them.

---I guess a Recluse registering as a Minion does not actually give the Cannibal that ability.
Q Does the Cannibal eating the Recluse misregistering as a Minion ping the Mathematician?
A Yes, any misregistration would ping the Mathematician.

Q Does the Pit-Hag picking a character that is in play register to the Mathematician?
A No, because their ability is working normally according to their own ability text.
  Even if you classified it is as abnormally working, it is due to their own ability, and not another character's ability
  (not just existing, the character's ability has to cause the abnormality.)

Q Do Djinn jinxes register as abnormalities to the Mathematician?
  For example:
  the Pit-Hag creating the Damsel and then the ST picking who to be the Damsel;
  the Spy not seeing the grim due to the Poppy Grower; ...
A There is no official stance or concensus on Djinn jinxes and the Mathematician.
  One opinion is that those are rules for how the characters work together so are not abnormalities.

Q The ST Poisoner, made by Plague Doctor dying, poisons a Townsfolk whose ability then malfunctions. Does it ping the Mathematician?
A Yes.  Even though the ST is not a player, a player has an ability malfunctioning, and it was technically caused by the Plague Doctor player.

----Unclear what this is asking.
Q Does the self poisoning Widow trigger the Mathematician once? Or does it trigger the Mathematician until they sober up?
  The Widow specifies "a good player knows you are in play", not "a good player starts knowing you are in play".
A No. The Mathematician only detects abnormalities due to other players' abilities.

Q Does a preached Minion count for the Mathematician ability?
  Does the Mathematician get a +1 per Minion preached?
A Only if the Minion should be doing something but cannot.
  So, for example, a preached Baron would never ping the Mathematician,
  but a preached Poisoner would be +1 each night that she is alive and preached.

Q If the Ojo picks a character that is not in play, would that trigger the Mathematician's number?
A No. The consequences are part of its own ability. (Unless the character actually was in play but another ability, like Recluse, caused misregistration.)

Q Does a self poisoned Snake Charmer choosing the Demon cause a Mathematician ping? 
A No, a self poisoning SC is not malfunctioning due to another character's ability.

Q The Exorcist picks the Demon. Is this +1 for the Mathematician?
A If the Demon should be waking up to use their ability, and they are not because of the Exorcist,
  then the Demon ability has malfunctioned and it counts.

Q Does the Dreamer seeing a good role and a Minion role when checking a Legion player ping the Mathematician?
A Yes.  The Dreamer is not seeing the correct character, due to another character’s ability.

Q If the Lunatic thinks that they are a Shabaloth, but the real demon is single kill demon such as the Imp
  - would that inherently add to a Mathematician number, 
  since the demon did not target the same two people as the Lunatic (instead, they only targeted one person)?
A Yes it does since the targets are different and that is how the jinx is worded.

----
Q If a droisoned player gets true info, is their ability considered to have malfunctioned for the sake of the Mathematician?
A No, their ability worked correctly

Q Does the Mathematician get a +1 if someone's ability is poisoned, but they get the correct information?
A No, their ability worked normally, so the Mathematician gets nothing.
 
  The Mathematician gets an uptick if, and only if, a player's character ability worked differently to what their token states.
  If a poisoned character gets true information, their ability is working exactly as it is stated on their token
  (since they still learnt the information they were supposed to learn).
  Hence, no abnormality. 
  The same applies if a mechanical ability would have done nothing, such as a poisoned (but not self poisoned!) Snake Charmer choosing a non-demon.

Q Does a player who is drunk or poisoned, or whose ability is affected by misregistration,
  still ping the Mathematician if they get true information?
A No, the Mathematician is only pinged if the information is incorrect.

  For example, the Empath sat between the Recluse and the Spy receiving a one, true information, does not ping the Mathematician, 
  even when the Recluse misregistered as evil and the Spy misregistered as good.
----
Q Does the No Dashii poisoned Sailor failing to drunk someone ping the Mathematician?
A Yes.

  The line in the SnV almanac "the Mathematician does not detect drunkenness or poisoning itself"
  refers to the fact that the Mathematician does not necessarily detect players that are drunk or poisoned,
  just ones whose abilities malfunction since the previous dawn due to those states.

Q Does the Demon's target being protected ping the Mathematician?
A Yes, the Demon's ability worked abnormally due to another character's ability, so that counts for the Mathematician.

=======
=Mayor=
=======
---
Q The Zombuul has died once, and there are three other players alive including the Mayor.
  If no executions are made, does the game continue? What happens?
A The Zombuul will register as dead to the Mayor, which means good wins.

Q Does the Mayor still win if three players register alive and nobody is executed, while the Zombuul is dead?
A Yes, the Zombuul registers as dead to the Mayor. It also has to be exactly three players so two does not work.
---

Q If the Demon hits the Mayor, can the Mayor bounce kill the sober Soldier? Since it is the Mayor killing the Soldier and not the Demon.
A No, the redirected kill is still from the Demon as a source so the Soldier cannot die if from a Mayor bounce to them.

Q Who wins in final three with the Mayor and the Vortox with no executions?
A The good team. Both abilities would trigger and since it is a tie between two character abilities good would win.

Q Can the Tea Lady protected Mayor still bounce an attempted kill?
A No.  The Mayor's ability is "ff you die". If they are protected, then the attack never hits in the first place and they do not die. Since they did not die, they cannot bounce.

============
=Mezepheles=
============
Q What happens if a good player says the Mezepheles’s secret word during N1,
  after the Mez’s point in the night order where they learn the word but before D1 starts?
A The good player turns on N2.

Q If the Mezepheles gets someone to say the word but they die by execution, does the person turn?
A No, because the Mezepheles' ability can no longer work in death.
  Note if the _target_ instead is dead, they can still turn.

Q Does the Sailor-drunk Mezepheles still turn a good player evil at night?
A If they are drunk at their spot in the night order no. 
  If they were drunk when the word was said but sober at their place in the night order yes.

Q Can the Mezepheles turn the Magician evil?
A Yes.  While the Mezepheles player thinks that the Magician player is the Demon,
  their Mezepheles ability registers the Magician as good,
  and therefore would turn them that night if they say the word.

==========
=Minstrel=
==========

Q If the public Goblin is executed while the Minstrel is in play, does the Minstrel immediately activate and prevent the Goblin's ability from winning the game?
A No, the Goblin win is triggered before the Minstrel can drunk them.

Q If it is a Minstrel day with the alive Scarlet Woman does the game end if the Demon is executed?
A Yes.

Q Does the Minstrel drunking also affect dead players for the purposes of situations like Vigor-killed Minions, the Plague Doctor ability, etc?
A The Minstel's ability reads "all other players (except Travellers)", so yes, dead players are still players.
  As per the ability text the only ones not hit are Travellers and the Minstrel themselves.
  Additionally, any Minion ability gained by the ST through the PD is not turned off as the ST is not a player.

======
=Monk=
======
Q If a dead Monk-protected player is targeted by the Al-Hadikhia, can they be resurrected if they chose live?
A Yes, living and resurrections are not considered harmful.

Q The Al-Hadikhia's first pick is Monk-protected and chooses die, while the other two picks choose live.
  Who dies?
A Just the other two die, barring other sources of protection.
  The Monk-protected player cannot die regardless of whether they choose live or die.
  The other two picks choosing live results in all three being alive so all dying, except the Monk protection again saves the first player.

Q Does the Monk protected, No Dashii poisoned, Minstrel proc after a Minion is executed?
A The Monk is not protecting the Minstrel when the Minion dies; the Monk only works during the night.
  The resulting No Dashii poisoned Minstrel does not proc.

---check this one:
Q The Monk protects the Pit-Hag holding Lil' Monsta.  Does the Monk block the PH from changing her character?
A No.  Changing characters is not considered a harmful effect so the Monk and Soldier cannot be protected from the Pit-Hag holding Lil' Monsta.

Q Does the Monk ability protect from positive Demon effects: regurgitating, resurrecting, etc.
A No, it specifically protects from harmful effects. Regurgitation and resurrection are not considered to be harmful.

Q Is a Monk protected Minion blocked from becoming the Imp when the Imp self kills?
A No, becoming the Demon is not consider a harmful effect.

===========
=Moonchild=
===========
Q The Pukka picks the Moonchild N1.
  The Moonchild is executed D1 and, while poisoned, picks a good player.
  N2 the Pukka picks another player so the dead Moonchild is now healthy at their their turn in the night order.
  Does the good player die N2?
A Yes.
  As soon as a good player is picked by the Moonchild, they are marked to die, regardless of the status of the Moonchild.
  As long as the Moonchild is sober and healthy at their turn in the night order, the scheduled death happens.


Q When does the Moonchild need to be drunk or poisoned for their ability to fail?
A They would need to be drunk or poisoned at the time in the night order when their ability is resolved, potentially killing someone.

Q If the Moonchild dies and chooses the Demon who is the same night snake charmered, does the former demon now poisoned Snake Charmer die?
A No. The ex demon was evil at the time of the Moonchild pick, so no kill was "scheduled” to hit her that night.
  The Moonchild ability, at their turn in the night order, simply ignores her.

Q What happens if the Moonchild picks a player that later flips alignment (Goon due to their own ability / Mezepheles turned / ...) before the Moonchild's turn in the night order?
A If the player is good at the time of the Moonchild's pick
  then they are marked with the Moonchild's reminder token,
  and die at the Moonchild's spot in the night order,
  regardless of whether they have become evil.
  
  If the player was evil at the time of the pick and became good at night, such as when the Goon is flipped, then they do not die.


========
=Mutant=
========
Q Does the Mutant's ability still counts if they are dead?
A No, characters do not have their abilities when they are dead unless otherwise specified.

Q The Mutant broke madness, and the town executed her. After the Mutant is dead, can the ST execute her?
A No, the dead Mutant has no ability.

Q Can the ST execute the drunk/poisoned Mutant for breaking madness?
A No, the Mutant ability to self execute would not work if they are drunk or poisoned.


===========
=No Dashii=
===========
Q If a No Dashii poisoned Townsfolk gets protected by the Monk they become unpoisoned. Does the next neighbour then get poisoned?
A No. The No Dashii poison does not skip over safe players, it only skips over non-Townsfolk.
  So just the one Townsfolk on the other side of the No Dashii would be poisoned.

Q Does the No Dashii poisoning move if one of her Townsfolk neighbours becomes a non-Townsfolk, due to the Pit-Hag for example?
A Yes. It also moves if someone closer than their current Townsfolk neighbour becomes a Townsfolk.
  It is constantly checking for who is the closest Townsfolk to the No Dashii's left and right, and poisoning those two players.



=====
=Ojo=
=====
Q If the Ojo targets the Village Idiot, do they all die or just one?
A Whenever there are multiples of a role in play, the Ojo kills one instance of them and it is the ST's choice.

Q What happens when the Ojo picks the Soldier?
A Nothing. The Soldier is targeted but cannot die so there are no Ojo deaths that night.

Q If the Ojo picks a role that is not in play, are kills arbitary, meaning there can be two kills,
  especially if there are multi-kill demons on the script?
A Sort of. The ST can choose any number of people to die to the Ojo
  but deaths are not arbitrary so the ST cannot save people who die from other abilities.
  There can be 0 kills or 2 kills or however many you like but one kill is still the recommended number most of the time.

Q Can the ST choose to sink a missed Ojo kill?
A Yes.


Q If a character has died and in the night the Ojo names them, does the ST kill them again or kill someone else?
  Is there a rule or is it just up to the ST because is not that character technically in play?
A The character is in play, so it would target the dead player and there would be no death from the Ojo that night.

Q What are the ST's options if the Ojo targets the Recluse?
A The ST has several options:
  * If the Recluse registers as the Recluse then the Recluse dies. 
  * If the Recluse is drunk or poisoned at the time then they have no choice but to register as the Recluse.
  * If the Recluse registers as anything else then there is no Recluse in play as far as the Ojo is concerned and so the ST chooses kills.


===============
=Organ Grinder=
===============
Q In an Organ Grinder game, where the OG is alive, healthy and sober, when exactly are the ghost votes taken away?  After the ghost vote is used or at the end of the day? 
A Ghost votes removed at the end of the day, so after all nominations and votes have happened,
  not after every vote as it is typically conducted.
  This is so that players cannot tell where ghost votes were used.
  It is the players' responsibility not to vote twice until then.

Q What is the reasoning for the Organ Grinder/Minstrel and Organ Grinder/Preacher jinxes?
A Those abilities do not play well together.
  It is a hard confirmed Minstrel day after a Minion is executed if there is no death at night and then no need to close your eyes for the vote. 
  It is basically hard confirmed that the Preacher picked the Organ Grinder if one day there is no need to close your eyes when previously you had to,
  or if you started off not needing to and then suddenly you do because the Preacher died.

  Abilities are not meant to be that hard confirmable most of the time. It is unbalanced to the point of broken so they are simply not allowed to be in play together.
 
Q Does the Organ Grinder affect exile votes?
A No, exile "votes" are not votes.
﻿


=======
=Philo=
=======
Q Does the Philosopher drunk the role or the player?
A The role.  If the player becomes another role (Pit-Hag / Barber swap / ...) then they become sober.

Q If N1 the Philosopher chooses Dreamer and is then picked by the Poisoner,
  is the Philosopher's once per game ability used up and the Dreamer sober?
A The Philosopher acts before the Poisoner so does gain the Dreamer ability. 
  While poisoned, the Dreamer is sober.
  Once they are healthy, the Dreamer is drunked again.

  If the Philosopher had picked on a later night while they were drunked or poisoned,
  then their once per game ability would have been lost,
  and the Dreamer, or whatever role they picked, would not be drunked.

Q The Philosopher chooses a role which is not in play. Later the Pit-Hag creates this role. Does the player with the new role come into the game already drunk?
A Yes, the drunkening is a constant check for if the character is in play.


Q If the Philo chooses Snake Charmer and becomes the Demon does the actual Snake Charmer becomes sober?
A Yes, and the former demon is now the self-poisoned Philosopher.

Q Could the Recluse not register as the Recluse so avoiding Philo-drunkening so that both the Recluse and the Philo-Recluse can both be working?
A Yes.

Q Can the Philosopher pick Philosopher and gain the ability of the Philosopher, turning them into the 'Philo-Philo', 
  effectively doing nothing other than creating a paradox on whether or not they get Philo-drunk?
A Yes, but that just results in a self drunking Philo.
  Droisoning paradoxes are mostly resolved as "everyone involved is droisoned".
  You could check in on the player in the morning and make sure they wanted to do that instead of trying to save their ability
  because they might have misunderstood the Philosopher.

Q If the Philosopher chooses to become the Heretic, do they keep their Heretic’s ability on death?
  Or is it that once they die, the Philosopher’s power no longer works, therefore they do not get the ability "even when dead"?
A Philos who gain "even when dead" abilities retain those abilities when they die.


Q The Philosopher obtains the Bounty Hunter ability N1, but is then targeted by the Poisoner.
  Would the Philo-Drunk BH now not be drunk on account of the Philo being poisoned?
  i.e. in this situation, would the OG Bounty Hunter be able to learn true information?
A Yes, if the Philosopher is poisoned, then the player they are drunking (if applicable) is temporarily not drunk, and would therefore have their ability work normally.

-----------------------some combining here
Q What happens if the Lunatic is Philo-drunk on N1?
A The Demon will learn the Philo as their Lunatic and learn any choices the Philo makes.
  The ST treats the Lunatic as if she were sober but, until the Lunatic sobers, the Demon does not learn her or her choices.

Q What does Philosopher Lunatic even do?
A The real Lunatic becomes philo-drunk.
  The Demon learns the Philo as the Lunatic so the Demon cannot follow the actual Lunatic, following the Philo-Lunatic's picks instead.
  The ST pretends to the original Lunatic (now drunk) that their ability is working normally
  The ST could show the Philo Lunatic to the real Lunatic as their Lunatic.
  As the Philo knows that they are not the Demon the ST does not need to show them bluffs, but can do so, and they could be in play characters.

Q If the Philosopher chooses Lunatic, how is the original Lunatic affected?
A The Demon learns the Philo-Lunatic as the Lunatic
  and learns their choices until they die and the normal Lunatic is un-drunked,
  then the Demon learns the original Lunatic and their choices.

  The Lunatic themselves is still treated as the Demon they think they are. From the Lunatic's perspective there is no change.

Q Is there any benefit to the Philosopher choosing Lunatic?
A The Philo gets to guide the Demon’s attacks.

  The real Lunatic will likely realize they are the Lunatic due to their picks not dying.
-----------------------------------

Q If the Philosopher Poppy Grower is poisoned on the first night what happens? 
A That depends on the source of the poisoning, as the Philo goes before roles like the Poisoner that choose.
  If the Poisoner chose them it would not stop it, but the No Dashii would.
  If the Philo PG is ever picked by the Poisoner the evil team do not learn each other, only in death can that happen.

Q If the Philosopher tries to gain the ability of a character that has a hate jinx with another character that is already in play,
  for example Engineer in a Legion game, what happens?
A It cannot succeed. Most STs would shake their head "no" and allow the player to make a different choice. 

  Another (harsher?) choice is that the Philo does not change and has used their OPG ability.
  As a jinxed role was picked, the ability is not gained,
  but the Philo does learn that the other character is in play
  (e.g. trying to gain the Engineer ability in a Legion game results in the ST showing the Philosopher the Legion token and putting them back to sleep)
  which is a tradeoff for the fact that the Philo effectively just burned up their ability.

Q If the Philosopher dies before the character they chose does, does the philo-drunkeness go away?
A Yes.

Q The poisoned Philosopher picks an each night role. 
  Do they ping the Chambermaid for each night that they wake up?
A Yes, they are waking for their own ability.

Q The Philosopher is poisoned for the night they use their ability (say to be a Fortune Teller).
  They become healthy the next night. Do they have the ability they chose by then?
A If the Philosopher is drunk or poisoned at the time they try to gain an ability, they fail to gain the ability and are a spent Philosopher with no ability.
  For as long as they remain drunk or poisoned, the ST should deceive them that they gained the ability by giving them arbitrary information when they would expect it.
  If they chose a mechanical ability, it will not work at all.
  But once they are sober and healthy again, the ST must treat them as a spent Philosopher that does not wake.

=========
=Pit-Hag=
=========
Q If the Pit-Hag creates a Demon but then loses their ability can an arbirtary deaths night still occur?
A Yes.  As soon as the Pit-Hag creates a Demon arbirtary deaths are global and cannot be removed.

  This covers:
  * the Vigormortis changing character causing the Pit-Hag to lose their ability
  * the Alchemist Assassin, whose ability cannot be blocked, killing the Pit-Hag
  * the Pit-Hag changing themselves to a Demon

Q After the Pit-Hag creates a demon and deaths are arbitrary, can the ST allow the Demon's kill to go through?
A Yes.

Q If the Pit-Hag changes another Minion to the Witch,
  then because the Witch comes before the Pit-Hag in the night order,
  does the new Witch wait until the following night to use their ability?
A Yes

  By the official strict night order ruling, that is correct.
  Some STs run it so that the Witch and the Cerenovus should get to act even if they were created that night, 
  and so long as the ST is consistent and sticks to the spirit of the night order, it is fine.
﻿
Q When do arbitary kills due to the Pit-Hag happen in the night order?
A The arbitrary deaths happen from during the Pit-Hag's turn in the night up to dawn.

Q When the Pit-Hag makes deaths arbitary, can the ST kill off players that are protected by the Innkeeper or the Lycanthrope?
A Yes, if the Innkeeper / the Lycanthrope is killed first.  Deaths may be arbitary, but protection still works.
  The Lycan's target can also be saved, as they pick after the PH acts.

Q The Gambler gambles wrong.  Later that night the Pit-Hag creates a Demon.  Can the Gambler survive because deaths are arbitary?
A No.

  The Gambler goes before PH in the night order and would be already dead by the time the Pit-Hag acts. 
  With the PH ability, the ST can only prevent subsequent deaths or cause new ones; they cannot resurrect the dead.

Q What happens if the Pit-Hag tries to create the evil Politician? Does it just fail, or do they learn they cannot do this and must choose again?
A The ST could remind the PH of the jinx if its a player they know is evil or they could choose to fail it otherwise.

Q Could the Pit-Hag turn the previous day's executee into the Barber or the Hatter and have their ability trigger?
A No. The Barber and the Hatter only trigger if they die, not if they are dead. 
  So if someone turned into Hatter or Barber after death, it does not trigger.
  Where abilities say 'when you die' or 'if you died' their triggers are on death.

Q Can the Pit-Hag make someone the Barber, then someone else the Barber after the first one gets Fang Gu jumped?
A If the Barber becomes the Fang Gu, then there is no Barber in play and it is valid for the Pit-Hag to make a new one.

Q Can the ST kill the Zombuul twice when there is a Pit-Hag Demon change?
A Yes.

Q If the Pit-Hag creates a Snitch, do the Minions immediately get extra bluffs?
A Not immediately, after kills and droisoning roles. Any starting info roles that enter the game on nights other than the first activate after kills and droisoning.

Q If the Pit-Hag changes somebody into the Drunk does the ST tell her that she got changed into a role?
A The Drunk ability reads "You think you are a Townsfolk but you are not", so the ST's options are:
  # tell her nothing, if she already thinks she is a Townsfolk, because she sees a Townsfolk token,
  # change her into a different Townsfolk, despite the fact that she is the Drunk.

Q Only one jinxed role can be in play so what happens if the Pit-Hag attempts to make a character that is hard jinxed by a currently in play character? 
  (e.g. trying to create the Spy/Widow while the Heretic is in play)
A The Pit-Hag attempting to make a character that is hard jinxed with an in-play character would simply fail in the same way it would if the character was already in play.
  The Pit-Hag is not informed of the failure.
  But if they tried to create a Heretic, the ST should probably shake their head no, point at the jinx area of the character sheet,
  and wait for a valid choice, because the PH has tried to make an invalid choice by their own character's rules.

Q If the Baron is created by the Pit-Hag or the Engineer, must the ST change two townsfolk into Outsiders?
A No, they do not change any Townsfolk into Outsiders. It is a setup ability, and setup abilities do not take effect if they come into play later.

  Plague Doctor has a specific jinx with Baron to cause players to turn into Outsiders should the ST gain the Baron ability mid-game.
  It is an exception to setup abilties coming into play later, not the rule.

Q Can the Pit-Hag create the Damsel?
A Yes, but as per the Jinx the ST chooses who becomes the Damsel.

  All Minions, including the Pit-Hag, learn immediately the Damsel is in play if the Damsel player is alive.
  If an evil Damsel is created, the evil team loses if a Minion guesses them.

  If the Damsel comes into play after previously being in play, incorrectly guessed and removed, then the Minions get a fresh Damsel guess.

Q The Pit-Hag turns a good player into the Marionette. What does that player learn?
A The Marionette has to think that she is a good character, so if a Townsfolk or Outsider is changed into the Marionette,
  the ST has several options:

  # tell the now-Marionette nothing, as she already believes that she is a good character
  # tell the now-Marionette that she is the character she already thought she was
  # tell the now-Marionette that she is a different good character than what she previously believed

  The first option is the most common, essentially it turns a player into a Drunk, except the Demon also knows who she is.
  But the other two options are viable depending on the game state.

  The ST has a similiar decision if someone is made into the Drunk, except that they can only believe they are a Townsfolk, not an Outsider.

Q Can the Pit-Hag create the Marionette?
A Yes, and the new Mario does not need to be sat next to the Demon.
  The Demon must be informed of their new Marionette.

Q Can the Pit-Hag create the Atheist?
A Yes, and the good team wins if the Storyteller is executed.
  But the ST can now use their new game-breaking rules to do anything including turn the Atheist into any other character if they do not want to deal with it.

Q What happens if a good player is Pit-Hagged into an Evil Twin?
A There is now a good player whose character is the Evil Twin.
  This new ability of hers causes her to be paired with an evil player and they learn who each other are:
  * the good-aligned twin learns what character the evil player is,
  * the evil-aligned twin learns the good player is the Evil Twin.

  While both twins are alive, good cannot win., and if the good-aligned twin is executed, then evil wins.
  
  The most obvious choice for the evil player would be the Pit-Hag,
  but the Demon could be chosen or a dead player if the game is almost at the end and good do not have enough time to execute two people.

------------------combine
Q If the Pit-Hag turns their Demon into a non-Demon role, does the game end immediately?
A If there is no living Demon, barring some other effect that would prolong the game (such as the Evil Twin ability if the Evil Twin and their opposing player are still alive),
  good would win because "no living Demons" is good's win condition.

Q If the Pit-Hag tries to turn the Demon into something that is not a Demon, what happens? 
A If that character is not in play, then the Demon becomes that character, and if no other living Demons exist the game is over and the good team has won.
-----------------------

Q Can the Pit-Hag turn a dead player?  Is that not a waste of their ability?
A They can and there are reasons for doing so:
  * to turn an alive player into that role requires getting it out of play first; such as removing a dead Assassin allows a new Assassin the next night.
  * they could be possibly revived or picked by another player that night
  * turning someone into the Politician still allows them to turn.
  * turning someone into the Drunk when they expect to be Professor revived, can be awesome to cause confusion.

Q Could the Spy or the Recluse misregister as another role so appear to be not in play so allowing a Pit-Hag to create another?
A Yes.

=======
=Pixie=
=======
Q If the Pixie is created late enough that there are no other Townsfolk alive, do they learn a dead in-play Townsfolk and just never get the ability?
A The Pixie created midgame can be shown a dead in play Townsfolk and will likely never get their ability.  
 
  A late game Pixie is essentially just confirming an in-play Townsfolk and should probably not be trying to gain their ability nor likely can they.
  
Q Can the Pixie learn themselves?
A Yes.

Q If no other player is a Townsfolk, does a Pixie just learn themselves?
A Yes.

Q If the Gambler dies to their own gamble, does the Pixie mad about the Gambler get to use that ability that night? 
A No, it is now past the Gambler's turn in the night order, as their death concludes their turn, so the Pixie-Gambler will act the next night instead.

Q Would the Pixie Artist be told "you do not have this ability" if they failed madness or the Artist did not die?
A Yes.

Q If the Pixie is made Cerenovus-mad about another character, does it break her initial Pixie madness?
A Generally, yes. If they are not Cere mad on a later day, they may still be able to bring it back around though.
  They can say "I was Cere mad yesterday, I am still the (madness target)".

Q The Slayer is killed by the Psychopath, and the Pixie-Slayer, if they had been mad enough, would immediately get the Slayer ability and be able to shoot the Demon, correct?
A Yes.

Q If the Pixie is droisoned at the moment their target dies, but then becomes sober/healthy that night, do they gain the ability?
A No, a droisoned Pixie cannot gain an ability. For as long as they are droisoned the ST can make them think they did though. 

Q What would happen if a character known to the Pixie becomes a different role, like a Farmer?
A That player still needs to die and the Pixie still needs to be mad as the character they were shown, and will receive the ability shown if sufficiently mad.

Q How does a Pixie who receives misinformation (poisoning / drunkening / Spy misregistering / ...) on their first night work?
A The Pixie still gains the ability they see if they are mad as that role, after the player marked with the Pixie mad token dies.
  
  If the Pixie is droisoned on their first night they will likely be shown an out-of-play role, and an arbitrary player is marked.
  As long as the Pixie is mad about the shown role and the marked player dies, they still gain the role they saw.

  In the situation where the Spy misregisters as a Townsfolk and that role is shown to the Pixie,
  the Spy is the marked player and must die in order for the sufficiently mad Pixie to gain the role shown.

===============
=Plague Doctor=
===============
Q What happens if the Plague Doctor dies multiple times?
A The ST gains multiple abilities.
  If all abilities are in play they can get an in play ability.
  That can happen if the PD is Barber swapped to a living player or a new one is made by the Pit Hag.
  There is no way for the ST to lose an ability they gained.

Q Can the ST lose the ability granted by the Plague Doctor if the Minion comes into play or a player gains the ability (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Engineer / Alchemist)?
A No.

Q If the Plague Doctor gives the Baron ability, does the ST tell the players who changed roles?
A Yes.

Q What happens if all Minions on a script are in play when the Plague Doctor dies?
A 
  * The ST gains an in play Minion ability.
  * The Alchemist, if in the game, can change abilities and duplicate an in play Minion ability.


Q What makes the Pixie gaining an ability different from the ST gaining a Minion ability from the Plague Doctor?
  If the PD gave the ST an ability and is then swapped away, the ST keeps the ability, right?
A Pixie and PD are run differently.

  The PD dies and their reminder token is put on the side of the grim indicating that the ST has gained an ability forever.
  At that point the ability the ST gains is independent from the PD ability.

  In contrast, the ability gained through the Pixie is a function of the Pixie ability and so intrinsically tied to it,
  same as the Philosopher who gains an ability loses it if they are switched to another character.

====
=Po=
====
Q If a player becomes the Po (Hatter / Engineer/ Pit-Hag), do their choices as their previous character have any effect?
A No. They can only kill no-one or one player on their first night.

Q If the Po charges, are they allowed to attack fewer than three people?
A No, the Po that chose to attack no one last time must now choose exactly three different players.

Q The drunk Po decides to charge.  Does that charge still count, or can they only pick no-one or one player the following night?
A Yes. The Po looks back at what it did the prior night; it does not matter whether they were drunk/poisoned or sober/healthy that night or not,
  their choice was still their choice.
  And if their choice was no one last night, tonight they must choose three players.

Q The Po chooses to charge.  The next night the Exorcist picks the Po. The night after that, how many players does the Po select?
A Three.

  The Exorcist prevents demons from making a pick the night that they are exorcised but does not change what the Po's last choice was.
  Additionally the Po can only kill three if their last choice was nobody.
  So if the Po chose no one, then the next night they were hit by the Exorcist, the night after that they must choose three, because their last active choice was no one.

  This differs from Courtier and Minstrel drunkening where the Po can still choose to kill one person or none and it will be applied despite their drunkenness,
  and their kill (should they choose to kill) just will not work because they are drunk.

Q Can the Po pick someone three times?
  Or do they have to pick a dead person to disguise their kills as less kills?
A They must choose three unique people. If they want to sink kills, they have to choose the dead.

Q If the Po charges, is then Courtier drunked, do they retain the charge or is it expended?
A They must pick three players the following day but none of them will die, nor will anyone they choose in the next two nights 
  (as long as the Courtier lives and is not drunked or poisoned)
  Compare with if they charge while drunk and then become sober, then they must pick three players who do die.
  In summary:
    At night: Charged
    In between: Gets drunk
    Following night: Chooses three in the night (none die)
    Night after that: Gets to choose one kill or charge again

Q If the Po figures out that they are drunk, can they refuse to use their ability ?
  e.g. A Courtier drunked Po is woken and told to choose three players, but instead they shake their head.
A No, that is not allowed.

Q What happens if the Po charged then is executed and passed to the Scarlet Woman. Do three kills still happen?
A No. It is a new instance of the character, so a reset of the ability.

============
=Politician=
============
Q Does the Politician work well in a Legion game?
A It is not that fun - the Politician is incentivised to vote on literally any execution but their own
  and be the single good vote Legion needs to pass every vote
  – it is difficult to claim they were not the most responsible for the good team's loss.

Q How does the Politician in a Revolutionary pair work?
A If the Politician is in a Revolutionary pair,
  it is the Politician who must be most responsible for the game end in order to potentially flip both players’ alignments,
  not the pair as a duo.

Q Can the Politician be Mezepheles turned, betray the evil team, and win with the good team?
A Yes.  The Politician is not restricted to only switching from good to evil at the end of the game, they can switch the other way too.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns himself into the Politician,
  could he campaign for his Demon's execution causing his team to lose, then flip alignment to win with the good team?
A No.  As per the jinx: the Pit-Hag cannot create an evil Politician.
  This prevents this exact scenario.

  The Pit-Hag role does not work great with alignment changers such as the Goon and the Cult Leader.

Q Can the Politician campaign for their own Fearmonger-execution and win with evil?
A Yes.

  The Politician flipping alignment does not change the result of the game;
  if they are Fearmonger-executed, the evil team's win is guaranteed.
  With the result decided, the ST must now consider if the Politician was most responsible for the good team losing.

  Arguably if the Politician successfully campaigns for their execution,
  perhaps after finding out that they were targeted,
  triggers the Fearmonger ability and causes the good team to lose,
  then the Politician should flip alignment and win with evil.

Q Can the Politician campaign for themselves to be the second good player execution in a Leviathan game and win with evil?
A Yes.

  The Politician flipping alignment does not change the result of the game;
  if they are the second execution of a good player then the evil team's win is guaranteed.
  With the result decided, if the ST then decides that the Politician was the main influence in causing their to team to lose,
  then the Politician can flip alignment and win with the evil team.

Q Can the Politician campaign for their execution on a Mastermind day and win with evil?
A Yes.

  The Politician flipping alignment does not change the result of the game;
  if they are the executed then the evil team's win is guaranteed.
  With the result decided, if the ST then decides that the Politician was the main influence in causing their to team to lose,
  then the Politician can flip alignment and win with the evil team.

Q How can the Politician win in an Atheist game?
A If the Politician successfully makes the entire good team believe that the Atheist is evil,
  and manages to get them to execute down to final 2,
  then they can be the only player that wins in an Atheist game.

Q How does it work if there is more than one Politician ability (Cannibal / Philosopher / Pixie / ...) in play?
A With multiple Politician abilities in play,
  there can be multiple players playing for the evil team.
  However, only the most responsible player can change teams, so they are in direct competition with one another.
  If any of these die while they have the Politician ability,
  they maintain the ability even if dead and can change alignments to win at the end of the game.

Q When does the Politician flip alignment in a Heretic game?
A The Politician’s changing of alignment is decided after the Heretic impacts the result of who actually won the game.

Q Can the Politician be the good twin to the Evil Twin?
A Yes, but don't; they will likely campaign for their own execution,
  never mentioning the twins,
  then win the game with evil as a result - it is pretty hard to argue they were not most responsible in that situation!

==============
=Poppy Grower=
==============
Q Does the Demon learn the Marionette in a Poppy Grower game on N1?
A No, assuming a sober and healthy PG ability.

Q What happens if in a Poppy Grower game the Pit-Hag turns their Demon into a non-Demon?
A If there is no Demon in the game and nothing else to keep it going, such as the Evil Twin, then the game just ends with good winning.

Q Do evil Townsfolk (Bounty Hunter / Mezepheles / Cult Leader) learn the evil team when the Poppy Grower dies?
A No, an evil Townsfolk is not a Minion or a Demon.

Q If the Poppy Grower is swapped out of the game (changed by Pit-Hag / becomes the Farmer / ...), do evil learn each other?
A No, the Poppy Grower must die for evil to learn each other.

Q If the Poppy Grower is in fact the Drunk, as opposed to being the drunked Poppy Grower, do evil still learn each other?
A Yes, during the Demon and Minion info steps.

Q If the Poppy Grower starts the game sat next to the No Dashii, do the evil players learn each other?
A Yes.

Q If the Demon kills the Poppy Grower at night, when does the evil team learn each other?
A As soon as possible.

Q What happens when the Lleech poisons the Poppy Grower?
A The PG is the poisoned host and unless evil can shift this (Pit-Hag makes a new demon / Barber swap / Hatter swap, ...)
  then evil will not be able to kill the PG without losing and so will never learn each other.

Q If the Snake Charmer succeeds in becoming the new Demon and the Poppy Grower later dies,
  will the evil team learn the old Demon or the new Demon?
A New Demon; the old Demon is no longer a Demon so would not be in any info.

Q If there is a dead Demon and a living Demon (Scarlet Woman / Fang Gu jump / ...) what is shown if the Poppy Grower dies? 
A All Minions learn every Demon, and all Demons learn of every Minion, regardless of living status.

Q If the Poppy Grower is ever poisoned or drunked, do the evil team learn each other?
A Only if they _start_ the game poisoned by being sat next to the No Dashii or start drunk due to the Puzzle Master.
  After N1,
  droisoning benefits the good team
  because it deactivates the second part of the Poppy Grower's ability, 
  meaning that if the Poppy Grower dies while droisoned, the evil team never learns each other.

Q If the Poppy Grower dies while droisoned, evil do not learn each other, correct?
A Correct.

Q Does the Pixie or the Cannibal gaining the Poppy Grower ability prevent evil learning each other when the PG dies?
A Yes. They get their ability immediately upon the PG's death, meaning there is no "gap" between the two abilities wherein evil would be able to learn each other.

Q If the Pixie sees the Poppy Grower and has been sufficiently mad then when the PG dies do Evil still learn each other or would the Pixie Poppy Grower hold it off for longer?
A The Pixie-PG would hold it off. Double PG abilities through Philo, Cannibal, or Pixie require them both to die sober/healthy in order for evil to learn each other.

Q If the Philosopher Poppy Grower dies while the Poppy Grower is alive, sober and healthy do the evil team learn each other as the ability says "if you die, they learn who you are"?
A No, because there is an active PG ability still in play.

Q If the Poppy Grower dies to the Demon at night (past the Poppy Grower's night order), does the evil team have to wait until the next night to learn their teammates?
A The evil team learn each other at the first opportunity after the PG dies. 
  If she is executed, that is the start of the night; if she dies at night, it is immediately after that death.

Q What happens when the Cannibal-Poppy Grower is the last living instance of the Poppy Grower ability
  but they lose their ability not when they die but when someone else is executed?
A Evil will never learn each other.

Q According to the jinx, the Spy / the Widow do not see the grim until the Poppy Grower dies.  What if there is a Cannibal Poppy Grower in the game?
A They see the grim when the last Poppy Grower ability (Cannibal / Pixie / Philosopher / ...) dies.

==========
=Preacher=
==========
Q If a preached Minion becomes another Minion (Engineer / Hatter / Pit-Hag / ...) do they lose their preached status?
A No, a preached Minion remains preached so long as they are a Minion.  They do become the new Minion but do not have their ability until the Preacher dies.

  If they are switched to a non-Minion they would no longer be preached, then could become an unpreached Minion with an ability again.  Until the Preacher picks them again ...

Q Can the ST gain the ability of a preached Minion when the Plague Doctor dies?
A No, the ability may not be functioning at the moment but it is still in play.

Q Does a preached Minion who dies and is then resurrected by the Al-Hadikhia regain their ability?
A No, they did not stop being a Minion when they died, and they are still preached provided the Preacher is still alive.
  (the Preacher's reminder token would still be next to them in the grim)
  
  In contrast, resurrecting the Preacher does not cause Minions to lose their ability again;
  as a fresh instance of the Preacher they must start their preaching over
  (when the Preacher originally died the ST would have removed their reminder tokens from the grim).

Q Does the Preacher dying giving the Minions a new instance of their ability or not?
  eg, an Assassin is preached after killing, the Preacher dies, can the Assassin kill again, or is re-activation simply just, as it was before.
A No,  It is a reactivation, not a new instance.

Q The Preacher and Vigormortis interactions:
    # The Preacher chooses a Vigor killed Minion: the dead Minion loses their ability, the neighboring Townsfolk is still poisoned.
    # The Preacher chooses a Minion who is then Vigor killed: the Minion is dead, poisons their neighbor, no ability.
    # either of the above then the Preacher dies: the Minion regains their ability.

A  All correct.

Q If the Preacher selects a Minion (say Devil's Advocate) and the Demon kills the Preacher the same night, should the DA's ability work that night?
A No.  The DA is woken before the Demon kills so the DA must wait to the following night to use their ability.

Q If a preached Minion becomes a different Minion (Barber / Hatter / Pit-Hag / ...), are they still preached and without an ability?
A Yes.  As long as they are an uninterrupted Minion, even if they change Minion type, they would still be preached. This is similar to Vigormortis in that sense.

Q If a preached Minion gain another Minion ability from the Plague Doctor, is that ability also nullified?
A Yes.  They would still gain an ability, but that ability would also be suppressed until the Preacher dies or is drunk/poisoned.

Q If a preached Minion becomes a different character type, say a Demon, and then becomes a Minion again, will they still be preached?
A No.  The moment they stop being a Minion, the preached effect ends on them and does not ever return unless the Preacher chooses them again when they turn back.

===========
=Professor=
===========
Q Can the Professor resurrect a Townsfolk turned evil (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter / ...)?
A Yes.

Q If there are three people alive going into night, Demon kills one of them (two people alive), and then the Professor resurrects one (three people alive), does Evil win?
A Evil won the moment there were only two people alive, which was immediately after the Demon chose a kill.
  The Professor does not get to act that night because the game was over already.

Q If there are no dead players, do you wake the Professor and tell them that?
A You would wake the Professor, prompt them to use their ability,
  and they would presumably shake their head and go back to sleep,
  or they might try to choose the player that they think died tonight (to no avail, because no one is dead)
  and you would put them back to sleep after a couple times trying,
  to prevent them from fishing.
  Telling them that no one is dead at their point in the night order is giving them too much information.
  Waking them is also important to roles such as the Chambermaid.

Q If the Professor picks an alive player, is their ability spent?
A No, the ST shakes their head to say that they should pick again,
  however if they’re just trying to see if others are dead or living, you should just put them to sleep.
  
Q If the Professor attempts to use their ability on a dead player when drunk/poisoned, is their OPG ability used up?
A Yes.

Q If someone is resurrected before the Professor wakes, and if the Professor tries to resurrect them (thinking they are still dead), is the Professor's ability lost?
A No as it would still be an invalid target. The ST should shake their head and prompt the player to pick again.


============
=Psychopath=
============
Q If the Psychopath self nominates, who do they play roshambo with?
A The ST.

Q If the poisoned Psychopath is executed, do they play roshambo and die whatever the result? Or do they die without playing?
A They just die without playing; mechanical effects do not happen while poisoned.

---
Q If the Alchemist Cerenovus chooses the Psychopath, and the Psychopath player breaks madness by choosing to kill the Alchemist, what happens? 
A The ST can choose to execute the Psychopath before the kill goes through or not.
  The Psychopath does not cause an instantaneous kill, as she must first publicly claim the ability and then choose a player,
  and could be executed mid sentence.
  If the ST does execute for the madness break then the Psychopath and ST will play roshambo to see if the Psychopath dies.

Q If the Psychopath is executed for breaking Cerenovus madness who do they play roshambo against? 
A The ST.  From the how-to-run:
" If the Psychopath nominates themselves or would be executed for another non-nomination reason
 (Cerenovus madness break, for example) the ST plays roshambo with the Psychopath." 
⁠
Q How do the Psychopath and the Vigormortis interact?
A The Psychopath keeps their ability if killed by the Vigormortis.
  So they can still name a player before nominations to die, and if their corpse is executed,
  they play roshambo with the person who nominated them .
  There is no reason to nominate their body though since they are already dead and cannot die again, but it would be amusing.

Q The Vizier forces the execution of the Psychopath. Do they play romshambo?
A The Psychopath and their nominator will play roshambo.

Q If the Psychopath who never claimed to be the Psychopath is executed, do they still play roshambo?
A Yes, with whomever nominated them.

Q If the Psychopath never claims that they are the Psychopath and are nominated, are they annouced?
A No, the ST does not directly state that they are the Psychopath.
  If they are executed then they play roshambo with their whomever nominated them, so it will be pretty obvious what they are.

Q The drunk Psychopath cannot kill anyone, correct?
A Correct. Drunk or poisoned characters do not actually have abilities.

=======
=Pukka=
=======
Q If the Pukka becomes another Demon (Pit-Hag / Hatter / ...), what happens to the previously poisoned player?
A They are immediately no longer poisoned and will not die tonight.

----------------------Combine
Q What happens when the Pukka kills a character with an ability that acts on death (Sweetheart / Barber / Plague Doctor / Hatter / ...)?
A Their ability does not trigger.

  The Pukka's kills always die poisoned.
  This is what allows the Pukka to kill characters such as the Sailor or the Fool who might otherwise survive thanks to their own ability.

  But dying poisoned also means that effects which trigger upon death malfunction meaning for example that:
  * the Pukka is not offered the Barber swap when the Barber dies
  * a good player is not drunked when the Sweetheart dies
  * the ST does not get an out of play Minion ability when the Plague Doctor dies
  * the evil players do not get to switch their roles when the Hatter dies
  * the evil team do not learn each other when the Poppy Grower dies

Q How does the Pukka poisoning interact with something like the Farmer/Ravenkeeper/Sage?
A These roles would die poisoned. A Farmer would not be able to create another Farmer, and the Sage and the RK may be given false information.
--------------------

Q If the Lycanthrope picks a good player in a Pukka game and gets Pukka poisoned afterwards, can there a Pukka kill tonight?
A Yes, the Lycanthrope pick and the previous night's Pukka pick since the Lycanthrope protection is now poisoned.


Q The text of Pukka says the previous person dies then becomes healthy.
  So if for any reason they do not die, are they still poisoned?
A They are separate events, one does not rely on another, so if the player is protected from dying, they still become healthy right after.

Q If the Pukka is chosen by the Exorcist does the previously poisoned player still die?
A Yes.

  The Exorcist only ever stops the Demon, if selected, waking up to use their own ability,
  but any other part of their ability still works.

  In this case, the Exorcist causes the Pukka to not wake,
  but she does not need to wake for the previously poisoned person to die,
  only to choose a new target.

  The Pukka is essentially delayed a day, so not waking tonight will mean someone not dying tomorrow.

Q If the Pukka poisons someone, and then dies, does their kill still go through (because for example, there is a Mastermind in play),
A Drunkening the Pukka keeps the poison in play, killing the player when the Pukka sobers,
  but killing the Pukka completely removes their ability from play: the poison is removed and the victim does not die.

Q What happens when the Pukka chooses while droisoned? Is the poison token moved? Is there going to be a night where nobody has the poison token? 
  Or does the poison token just stay in place?
A If the Pukka is drunk/poisoned,
  - the player who already has the poisoned token is temporarily healthy
  (some STs choose not to remove the token entirely to help them remember; some turn it upside down) 
  - and no new token is placed down.
  On the next night the Pukka is sober/healthy, the poisoned player is re-poisoned,
  and the Pukka's choice will now cause a new poisoned token to be placed down.

----------------
Q How do the Pukka and Monk interact? 
A The Monk is very strong vs the Pukka.
  If the Pukka chooses a Monk-protected player, they do not become poisoned, and the following night there will be no Demon kill.
  If the Monk chooses the Pukka’s previous choice, it works like the Pukka-Innkeeper interaction in that the pick does not die and becomes healthy.

Q In order to not die to the Pukka, does a player need to be Monk protected the night they are picked by the Pukka or the following night when they would die?
A Either.

  * If they are protected the first night then the Pukka poison is never applied, so there is no "previously poisoned player" the following night.
  * If instead they are protected the following night then they do not die and become healthy.

  The Pukka's target does not need to be protected on both nights: if they were protected on the first night, then the Monk is free to protect someone else the following night.
  From the Monk's perspective they have two good targets available to them, the player targeted the night before or the one targeted tonight - the Monk is super strong in a Pukka game.
----------------------

Q If the Monk-protected player is picked by the Pukka, are they poisoned that night?
A No (the ST does not place the Pukka poison token next to them), and they do not die the following night.

Q If the Monk-protected player is picked by the Pukka, do they still die the next night?
A No, nor are they Pukka poisoned the night they are picked.

Q If the Monk protects a player who was Pukka poisoned on the previous night, even though that player was the "previously poisoned player", they will not die tonight, right?
A Correct.  The player does not die and becomes healthy.

Q N1 player X is Pukka poisoned. N2 the Monk protects player X but is then later targetted by the Pukka. What happens to player X?
A Player X is no longer poisoned while Monk protected, but when the Monk becomes poisoned, the protection is removed.
  As player X is still the previously poisoned player, they die.

Q If the Monk-protected player is picked by the Pukka, they are not poisoned and do not die the next night, but does the Pukka's previous pick still die tonight?
A Yes.

--------------------------------combine
Q The Pukka chooses a player, then the following night chooses herself.  Does the player picked the previous night still die?
A No.  The Pukka is poisoned and their ability does not work while poisoned, including the "the previously chosen player dies and then becomes healthy" portion of their ability.
  As well as not dying, the previously poisoned player becomes healthy, as the Pukka's ability to poison them has been disabled.

  For the rest of the game the Pukka is permanently poisoned.

Q If the Pukka self-picks, they are poisoned forever but what happens to their previous pick?
A The previous pick becomes healthy, because the Pukka ability that was poisoning them is itself poisoned, and does not die.

Q Can the Pukka selfkill?
A No. As soon as she picks herself she is poisoned for the rest of the game.  Because she is poisoned she cannot cause herself to die.

Q What happens if the Pukka poisons herself?
A She is permanently poisoned for the rest of the game and cannot kill anyone, including herself. If they somehow become healthy, they will die the next night.
------------------------

Q How do the Pukka and the Ravenkeeper interact? Is the Ravenkeeper healthy or poisoned when she gets her information?
A The Pukka picks the RK. The next night after the Pukka picks another player to poison, the RK dies poisoned and gets poisoned info.

Q The Pukka picks someone to poison and the next night the Courtier drunks the Pukka.
  After three nights, the drunking wears off and the Pukka chooses a new player.
  Does the person poisoned before the drunking die that night? 
  As in, is the poison suspended but stays on the target during the drunkenness?
A Yes, however during those those nights that person would not be poisoned.

Q If the Pukka poisons a player, and then that player does not die the following night despite the Pukka being sober and healthy (due to the Tea Lady, for instance),
  does the previously poisoned player become healthy, even though they did not die? 
A They still become healthy.

Q Does the Goon-drunk Pukka the next night kill the player that originally poisoned when they became drunk?
A Yes. The sequence of events is like this:
  N1: The Pukka chooses A.
  N2: The Pukka chooses the Goon and is Goon-drunk. A is temporarily healthy and does not die.
  N3: The Pukka is sober again. The poison on A comes back. The Pukka chooses B (not the Goon). A dies and becomes healthy.

Q If the Pukka died, but the game continues (due to Scarlet Woman / Mastermind / ...) will the previously poisoned player die?
A No. In order for the demon to kill she must be alive.
  Also, the Pukka-posioned player becomes healthy as soon as the Pukka dies.

Q Can the Pukka poisoned Fool die even if she has yet to use her ability?
A If the Fool is poisoned, then she does not have her ability, so she will die the first time she is killed.
  The same goes for the Sailor.

Q If the Pukka passes to the Scarlet Woman, is the previously poisoned player still poisoned and scheduled to die?
A No. As a new instance of the Pukka, the ability resets.

==============
=Puzzlemaster=
==============
Q If the Puzzlemaster becomes a different character, is their drunkeness removed from game?
A Yes.

Q If the Puzzlemaster's target changes character, is that player still drunk?
A Yes.  For as long as the Puzzlemaster is in the game and healthy and sober, the picked player is drunk, even if that player changes character.

Q Could the Puzzlemaster drunk a role in a hate jinx pair, allowing the other role to enter play?
A No. Hate jinxes are a part of setup whereas the Puzzlemaster has no setup ability; the puzzledrunk player is decided after tokens have been distributed.
  So pairs of hate jinxed characters still cannot be placed in the token bag in a Puzzlemaster game.

  On the other hand, if one of the hate jinxed pair is _the_ Drunk then both roles can be put in the token bag, as then only one of the roles is techically in play.

Q When does the Puzzlemaster guess?
A During the day.

Q If a character is drunk because of the Puzzlemaster, are their setup abilities in effect?
A Yes. Puzzlemaster drunking occurs after all of the setup.

Q If a dead player is Pit-Hagged into the Puzzlemaster, is a player made Puzzlemaster-drunk?
A No.
  Their ability reads "1 player is drunk, even if you die", rather than "even if you are dead",
  so the Puzzlemaster does not start making someone drunk if they enter play while already dead.
  The Puzzlemaster must be alive to drunk a player and when they die continue to drunk that player,
  which prevents Puzzlemasters from just getting themselves killed early to stop making their teammates drunk.

Q Does the Puzzlemaster that guessed wrong in a Vortox game gets the correct Demon?
A No. Puzzlemaster is an Outsider and is therefore not affected by Vortox.

Q If the Puzzlemaster guesses their drunk player in a Legion game, what happens?
A They are given any one Legion, ST's choice.
  It should also be a living Legion, as the ability says "the Demon" and when there are multiple Demons in the game,
  that means living Demons who are "the" Demon (while both living and dead Demons are "a Demon").

Q If the Puzzlemaster guesses their drunk player on a Mastermind day with no Demon alive, what happens?
A If all the Demons are dead then the ST chooses one of the dead Demons.

Q If the Puzzlemaster guesses their drunk player and there is no Demon in the game,
  after the Demon was pit-hagged out of the game with an Evil Twin in play,
  what happens?
A The ST will tell them no one.

Q If the Puzzlemaster is droisoned, is the puzzle-drunk player still puzzle-drunk?
A If the Puzzlemaster is drunked / poisoned, their ability does not work,
  so the person they have made drunk is temporarily sober (the ST can indicate this by turning the Puzzlemaster drunk reminder token upside down)

Q If the Puzzlemaster is created mid game, does the ST immediately make someone puzzle-drunk?
A Yes.

=========
=Recluse=
=========
Q Can the Recluse, registering as a Minion, successfully guess the Damsel?
A Yes, ending the game.

  They could also learn the Damsel is in play if they register as a Minion at any time,
  but it is generally not the point of Outsiders that they can be hard-confirmed to other players, so do not do this.

Q When the Snake Charmer swaps with the Recluse, there are no alignment changes,
  so after telling the Recluse that they are now the Snake Charmer, are they told that they are good?
A No, players are only informed of their alignment after it changes.
  If they ask the next day then the ST can explain that they are only informed of aligment when it changes,
  so they can probably work out that they are still good from this.
  
  They will not know for sure if they changed character because of the Pit-Hag / Snake Charmer / Barber / ...

Q Is it legal to show the Recluse to the Demon as a Minion?
A Yes, but don’t.  That would be an Outsider ability hurting evil.

Q Can the Recluse register as a good Minion/Demon?
A Yes.

Q If the Recluse dies, could they misregister as a Demon and trigger the Scarlet Woman? What would the SW become?
A They could, but probably should not.

  The SW's ability explicitly says "you become the Demon."
  They would become whatever Demon the ST registers the Recluse as, but never a Recluse.

Q Can the Recluse be told that there is a Damsel?
A Yes but don't.

Q If the Recluse is picked by the Snake Charmer, could the SC become the Demon?
A Yes.
  "Each night, choose an alive player: a chosen Demon swaps characters and alignments with you and is then poisoned."
  So if the Recluse registers as the Demon the swap happens,
  with the Snake Charmer becoming the Recluse or whatever Demon is on the script that the ST thinks the Recluse is registering as,
  and the Recluse becoming a self-poisoned Snake Charmer.

Q Could the Imp with no living Minions starpass to the Recluse?
A Technically, yes; however, this makes the Recluse into the good Imp, meaning that they need only to get themselves killed in order to win.
  So it is not recommended for the Imp to do this.

Q Can the Recluse register as the Spy and trigger a Virgin?
A No.

  The Recluse only registers as the Spy, but does not gain the Spy ability, therefore cannot register as a Townsfolk.
  Think of registering as: if an ability "asks" a player about their character or alignment or living status, they can "answer" with something other than what they are.
  Misregistering can never change the game directly (like executing someone).
  It can however trick someone else's ability into doing it for them
  (like the Spy who nominates the Virgin - the Spy's ability cannot kill themselves, but it can trick the Virgin's ability into thinking they are a Townsfolk,
  after which the Virgin's real ability can execute them).

Q If the Recluse is in play, the Scarlet Woman is on the script and the Zombuul is executed, can the Recluse register as the Scarlet Woman and become a good Zombuul?
A No, they do not actually have the Scarlet Woman's ability.
  If the Recluse dies the Scarlet Woman can become the Demon however.

Q If the Snake Charmer is pit-hagged into the Recluse, 
  is the ST allowed to show the former SC "you are now the evil Pukka" using the Recluse's register as a Demon ability?
A No.

  The ST is not allowed to lie to the player about their character or alignment unless the ability allows for that specifically (like Lunatic, for example).
  The Recluse does not believe they are anything else; they always know that they are the Recluse.

  The ST could never falsely tell the Recluse they are evil, a Minion, or a Demon.
  The Recluse's ability of possibly registering as evil does not allow them to believe that they are the Demon.
  This is opposed to the wording on the Drunk or Lunatic which specifically say they believe they are something else.

===============
=Revolutionary=
===============
Q Could the Revolutionary cause the Damsel to register falsely as something else when guessed by a Minion?
A Yes but don't.

Q Could the Revolutionary cause a good player to register falsely as a Minion when they accuse someone of being the Damsel?
A Yes but don't.

Q How does a Revolutionary pair work if the first half draws the Lunatic?
A The other person is given any good character.  The Lunatic player will probably figure it out immediately.

======
=Riot=
======
Q What is the Hatter jinx with Riot?
A If the Hatter dies in a Riot game, and a Riot chooses a different Demon, a normal evil team is created from the Riot players.

  If the Hatter dies and the Demon chooses Riot, the Minions become Riot too.

Q Can there be a call to exile a Traveller while there is a Riot active?
A No, the call should be made before nominations open.

  From the experimental-how-to-run:
  Calling for the exile of a Traveller does not kill them immediately.
  Riot only affects nominations, so a Traveller exile vote should be run as normal.
  There should be no interruptions once a Riot nomination train is rolling, so all calls for Traveller exiles should occur before nominations open.

Q If a Townsfolk nominates the Virgin in a Riot game, which ability takes priority?
A From the experimental-how-to-run:
  "If the Virgin is nominated by a Townsfolk in a Riot game,
  the Virgin dies and the Townsfolk is immediately executed, ending the day"
  If it is day three, the game ends and the evil team wins. 
  After all, it is the Virgin's job to ask Townsfolk to not nominate her, or do it before day three.s

Q Can each Riot be told different bluffs, or do all of them have to receive the same three?
A ST choice.
  When there are multiple Demons (like Legion), if the ST wants, each Demon can receive different bluffs.

Q How would a Riot and Golem interaction work? The Golem nominated Riot, the Riot did not die but do they get another nomination?
A Based on how Soldier is explained, players who do not die do not have to nominate but can.

Q In a Riot game, is there an extra minion in play? (for example, four total evil in a 12 player game)
  In a Lil' Monsta specifically says there is +1 minion, but Riot does not specify this.

A No +1 Minion, because the Demon is already Riot, so there is the usual number of evil players who are all are Riot.

  The Lil' Monsta adds +1 Minion because the Monsta token does not actually go into the bag; the extra Minion is dealt so that there are the correct number of evil players.
  In the case of Riot, the correct number of evil tokens are going into the bag because you add that many Riot tokens, so it does not need to add an extra Minion.
  (There are not supposed to be Minions in Riot games, the problem for good is that every starting evil player is a Demon, so they need to get rid of every evil player to win.) 
  Remember, no player is the Lil' Monsta; the Minions have to choose a babysitter for the Lil' Monsta each night,
  and this makes that player count as the Demon for all game mechanics that care.

======
=Sage=
======
Q Would the Sage wake up if they are killed by a nomination from the Demon?
A No, unless it is a Riot game because of the jinx.

Q Does a Mayor bounce to the Sage register as a Demon kill?
A Yes. 

  The Demon is still the source of the attack and the ST would place the Demon's dead token.

========
=Sailor=
========
Q Can the Gossip kill the Sailor?
A Only if the Sailor is drunk or poisoned, otherwise the Sailor cannot die by any means except to the Assasssin.

========
=Savant=
========
Q Can the Recluse register good in the first part of Savant info, and then register evil in the second part, or do they have to register the same in both parts of the Savant info?
A If you are running with misregistration in Savant info (which there is some contention about)
  then yes, the Recluse (and even the Spy) can register differently to two parts of a single ability.

Q Can the poisoned Savant receive two true statements?
A Yes, assuming no Vortox is in play. 

===========
=Scapegoat=
===========
Q Not that you should, but can the Scapegoat save the good Evil Twin or the Saint from being executed?
A Yes.

===============
=Scarlet Woman=
===============
Q If the Demon is executed in a final five, does the Scarlet Woman catch the demonhood?
A Yes, as it needs to be five alive at the time of the execution for the Scarlet Woman.

Q Can the Demon who was the Scarlet Woman guess the Damsel?
A No, they are no longer a Minion.

Q What is the Al-Hadikhia jinx with the Scarlet Woman?
A If there are two living Al-Hadikhias, the Scarlet Woman Al-Hadikhia becomes the Scarlet Woman again.

  This means that if the Scarlet Woman turned Al-Hadikhia resurrects the Al-Hadikhia,
  they revert to being the Scarlet Woman rather than staying the Demon themselves as well.

Q There are five players left alive including the Imp and the Scarlet Woman.  The Imp is executed, leaving four alive.
  Does the SW activate?
A Yes.

Q If the Slayer slays the Imp, but the Scarlet Woman is in play, what happens?
A Assuming none of these players are poisoned or drunk, in Trouble Brewing, if there are five or more players when the Slayer slays the Imp,
  the Imp dies and the Scarlet Woman will immediately become the Imp,
  The former SW should be informed at the next available opportunity the following night that they are now the Imp, before getting their kill.

Q In a Poppy Grower game, the Psychopath kills the Demon and then, later that same day, the Slayer chooses the Scarlet Woman. Does the SW die?
A Yes. The SW became the Demon even before they were informed.
  The SW's ability takes over the Demonhood immediately upon the Demon's death.
  If they did not, then the game would technically be over in the space between the Demon's death and the night phase.

Q If a Scarlet Woman becomes the Demon during the middle of the day (due to the Slayer, the Witch, ...), when are they informed?
  Should they ask?
  Do they have to wait until the SW's turn at night?
A Wait until the start of the next night phase.
  The SW's position in the night order is really just a reminder in case the ST forgots to inform them of the demonhood after the Demon died during the day.
  So if you get to that point and realize you have not yet, no big deal.
  
  Trigger based abilities are meant to happen the moment they trigger, 
  with any relevant things that may need to be done, or info given, at the first reasonable opportunity,
  often the start of the night. 
  The night order for trigger abilities should be considered flexible.


﻿
Q If the Scarlet Woman catches the demonhood, but is then instantly Snake Charmed,
 would they learn who the King, Marionette and Lunatic are?
A Yes, they are woken to learn those things before the Snake Charmer acts.

===========
=Shabaloth=
===========
Q What if four players go to night with the Shabaloth alive? Does the Shabaloth killing two players happens at the same time as the revival of a previously killed player?
  Or when four players go into the night with the Shabaloth in play is it effectively the end of the game?
A Regurgitation, if the ST chooses to do it, happens before the Shabaloth's killls, so there would be five alive then two would die, and the game can continue.

Q Can the Shabaloth choose to regurgitate people?
A The Shabaloth does not control whether someone is regurgitated; that choice falls to the Storyteller.

Q Can the Shabaloth pick the same player twice?
A Not on the same night, since that would still only amount to one player being chosen.
  The clause "choose two players” is not equal to "choose a player, then make that same choice again”.
  It specifically requires two unique players to be chosen in order to satisfy.

Q Could the Scarlet Woman who becomes the new Shabaloth resurrect the old Shab?
A The ST should never use the Shab's ability to resurrect another demon.

Q Does the Shabaloth victim's revival occur before or after the Demon picks?
A Before.

Q Does the Shabaloth get shown who is regurgitated that night before she picks her next two kills?
A No, the Shabaloth is not told anything about regurgitations.
  The ST makes the decision on regurgitation before the Shabaloth wakes, 
  (i.e. before the kills)
  then wakes the Shab and have her point to two players.
  Then deaths and resurrections/regurgitations are announced at the start of the day, and the players adjust their life tokens on the Town Square board accordingly.

Q The Ravenkeeper regurgitated by the Shabaloth can have their ability activate again right? So their ability works twice?
A Yes.

Q How exactly does the Shabaloth work? When does regurgitation happen?
A If the Shabaloth chose two people the night before, then just before they attack tonight, one of those people they chose, if they are currently dead, may come back to life.
  Note that if the Shabaloth is chosen by an Exorcist and does not wake to attack anyone tonight, they can still bring one of their previous night's targets back to life 
  because regurgitation is not tied to their waking up. 

  Note that the Shabaloth's previous targets do not need to have been killed by the Shabaloth's attack in order to be revived,
  they only need to be dead on the next night.
  This means that the Shabaloth can choose someone who is already dead and revive them the next night,
  or the Shabaloth's target can survive the attack,
  then die the next day and subsequently be revived because they are now dead in time.


========
=Slayer=
========
Q Can the Slayer who is made Cerenovus mad use their ability have the resolution of that ability interrupted by a madness execution ending the day?
A Yes.

Q When is the last moment a character can activate their ability? 
  Should the Slayer be allowed to use their ability after the day's execution has been carried out?
A Any time before they die, and before the day officially ends.
  So after they are on the block but before they are actually executed is fine.
  Most STs also allow a few seconds for day abilities between the execution and officially declaring the day over and night beginning,
  but that might vary by ST, so players should clarify what is allowable before relying on that window.
  Most would not allow the Slayer their shot after their execution as they are dead.

Q If the Slayer kills the Demon will there still be nominations that day?
A If the game ends, then there will be no nominations.
  If the game continues, say due to a Scarlet Woman, nominations continue as normal.

Q Can the Slayer shoot mid vote?
A Yes, but the ST might want to finish resolving the vote first and the player may have repeat their target in case the ST did not hear it or forgot.
  The ST may not be inclined to let the Slayer kill or clear someone in the middle of the vote,
  so the Slayer might want to do it before, so that there is no need to vote, or after, to convince town to lift.
  
===============
=Snake Charmer=
===============
Q What happens if the Cannibal Snake Charmer chooses the Demon?
A The Demon becomes the poisoned good Cannibal.  They are not told that they are poisoned but will deduce that they Cannibal SC picked them.

Q If the dead self-poisoning Snake Charmer is resurrected (Professor / Al-Hadikhia) are they now healthy?
A Yes, as they are treated as a new instance of the character.

Q If the Snake Charmer and the Demon swap, does the new Demon learn who the Minions are?
A No, unless the Poppy Grower is killed after that.

Q Can the ST show a poisoned Snake Charmer that she turned into the evil Demon?
A Yes, but it is not recommended.  
  The ST can even give a fake Lunatic, tell her the next night that she killed the Poppy Grower, ...

Q If the Snake Charmer chooses a dead demon, does she become the Demon?
A The Snake Charmer must choose alive players.

Q The Snake Charmer picks the Pukka.  Does the old Pukka's pick from the previous night get nullified so there are no deaths this night?
A Yes.

Q What is the difference between getting snake charmed and getting hit with a Philosopher snake charm?
A In the first case the Demon becomes a self-poisoned Snake Charmer, while in the second case she becomes a self-poisoned Philosopher.

Q What happens if the Snake Charmer hits the Lleech?
A 
  # The Snake Charmer becomes the new Lleech.
  # The ex-Lleech becomes the poisoned Snake Charmer 
  # The previous host is no longer poisoned or a host, so the ST removes the host token from the host.
  # The new Lleech, just as if it was N1, gets to pick a new host.
  
Q Does the new Demon wake and kill after a Snake Charmer swap?
A Yes, assuming their Demon character wakes that night, since they are after the SC on the night order. 

Q The Philosopher picks Snake Charmer, philo-drunkening the original SC, and then chooses the Demon.
  So the starting Philo is now the evil Demon and the starting Demon is now the poisoned good Philo.
  What happens when the original no longer Philo-drunk Snake Charmer chooses this new demon?
A In the case of a Snake Charmer and a Philosopher with the Snake Charmer ability both in play, 
  the ST decides who acts first, which is important for this question.

  If the Philosopher-SC acts first and becomes the Demon, 
  then the old Demon becomes a poisoned Philosopher and the actual SC becomes sober
  (Why would the original Snake Charmer become sober? 
   Because the Philo causing them to be drunk is no longer in play; we have a new instance of the Philo)
  Now the Snake Charmer can also choose the new Demon (the game's starting Philo) and swap to the Demon
  ...this gives us the possibility of a player (the OG Philosopher) going from good Philo to evil demon to good self poisoned SC,
  What happens to the OG demon (who became the self poisioned Philo)?
  The original Demon would still be the self poisoned Philosopher, the second snake charming would not change that.

  Depending on the kind of game you like to run and your players would like to experience, 
  generally it would be recommended to have the Philo-drunk Snake Charmer choose first to prevent this overload of shenanigans.

========
=Snitch=
========
Q The Pit-Hag creates a Snitch causing the Minions to learn not in play characters. Are dead players considered not in play characters?
A Dead characters are still in play.
  The only out of play characters are those that are on the script, but not currently assigned to any player (LM being an exception).

Q Can the Minions learn evil characters via the Snitch?
A Yes, if the ST wants that. The Snitch's text does not specify "good characters”. 

Q About the Marionette / Snitch jinx,
  when the Demon sees an additional three out of play characters, can they overlap with the first three bluffs they saw?
A No, additional means just that, so the Demon sees more different characters.
  But, Snitch bluffs do not have to be good roles,
  useful if the ST think the Demon is good as is, or is running out of tokens for a full game.

=========
=Soldier=
=========
Q Minions killed by the Vigormortis poison a Townfolk neighbour.  Is the Soldier safe from this poisoning?
A Yes, as it is a Demon ability that causes the poisoning.

Q Can the sober Soldier die during the night in a Lil' Monsta game?
A Not to the Lil' Monsta or the babysitter, as the source of the kill is still the Demon even when the ST picks the target.
  It is possible for the Soldier to die to non Demon sources.

Q Can the soldier die in a Legion game?
A Not to Legion, as a Legion player counts as both a Demon and a Minion, and the source of the kill is still a Legion player even when the ST picks the target.

Q Is the Soldier safe from the Demon using the Barber swap on them?
A No.

Q If the Soldier is sitting next to the No Dashii, they are not poisoned since they are safe from the Demon.
  However if the Poisoner hits them, they get No Dashii poisoned.
  Once the Poisoner's poison wears off, is the Soldier still No Dashii poisoned?
A Yes.

Q The Soldier is safe from the No Dashii's poison, but is she also safe from the Pukka poison and the subsequent kill?
A Yes, and she is also immune to the Lleech's poison, but is still the host, just an unpoisoned host.

=====
=Spy=
=====
Q Can the Spy be poisoned by the No Dashii?
A The poisoning would sort of loop: 
  # The Spy who neighbours the No Dashii and registers as a Townsfolk becomes poisoned.
  # Being poisoned, the Spy can no longer register as a Townsfolk.
  # The No Dashii poisoning must move to the next neighbour as the current target is not a Townsfolk so no longer valid
  # The Spy is no longer poisoned and regains their ability.

  But the ST is free to repeatedly move the poison from the Spy to the next Townsfolk and back, to their own delight for as long as they want.

Q Can the Spy registering as good become the Farmer?
A Yes.

Q Can the Spy register as not a Minion and stay as the Spy despite an attempted Engineer swap?
A Yes.

Q If the Ojo targets a Townsfolk, say the Monk, can the attack be redirected to the Spy registering as such?
A Yes but don't.

  The Spy misregistering as a good character can cause her:
  * to die instead when the Ojo targets any good character.
  * to survive if the Ojo targets the Spy, causing an Ojo miss so the ST picks the kill(s).

  Additionally:
  * if the Spy does register as the intended target there is still only one death, so the ST could kill off both the actual target and the Spy.
  * the Spy could still register as the Spy and be killed by the Ojo.

  This logic also works with the Recluse: picking any evil character can kill the Recluse instead and picking the Recluse can have the Recluse not register as the Recluse, and therefore be a miss 

Q If the Spy is drunk / poisoned, does she still get to view the grimoire or does she get to view a fake version of the grimoire?
A The ST could show the drunk / poisoned Spy any version of the Grimoire that they wished:
  * the correct one, 
  * something totally wild,
  * the grim with just change one or two small changes to throw off what the Spy thinks the gamestate is.

  Since showing her the correct grimoire works against the idea of the Spy malfunctioning,
  and showing her a wildly inaccurate grimoire tips her off that she is getting bad info, 
  the simpler approach is just to show her that different people are malfunctioning,
  then watch her report that the Mayor or the Slayer is powerless, and then surprise!

Q When showing the (healthy and sober) Spy the Grimoire,
  can the ST replace a (healthy and sober) Recluse's token with any Minion or Demon token, 
  and/or the Spy's own token with any Townsfolk or Outsider token?
  (for example, could you replace the Spy's own token with the Drunk token for funs and giggles?)
A Yes, and it is used sometimes, for example, to show what the Spy was seen as to the Washerwoman or the Librarian.

Q When the Spy sees the Grim, is it just the roles or also the reminder tokens used?
A It is whatever the ST has in the Grim at the time really. They can remove the reminder tokens if they want, but most STs would not and do not.

Q Can the Spy be the red herring?
A Yes, though it is kinda sneaky. The Spy can also start registering as evil at some point, causing the RH to move to another good player (even sneakier). Use caution.

Q Could nominating the Spy who is registering as the Virgin cause the nominator to be executed?
A No. Registering as something does not give that player the ability.

Q Can the Spy register as the Damsel and then the Recluse be told that there is a Damsel?
A No. The Spy registering as a role does not gain that role's ability.

Q Can the sober and healthy Slayer hit the Spy, who registeres as the Recluse, which then registers as the Demon?
  Or does the "register as" chain end at the Recluse, ability not being factored in? 
A Registering as something does not give you their ability.
  So the Spy registering as the Recluse cannot then register through the Recluse's ability, since they do not have it.

Q If the Spy is juggled twice, once as the Spy and once as the Juggler, can the Juggler receive a two, or can the Spy only register as one character for the whole ability?
A 0, 1 and 2 are all valid numbers for that juggle. 
  Comparing with the Spy/Chef interaction, getting a two is valid.
  But, just because an ST could give a two, does not mean that she should.

Q If the Spy is preached and later dies, do they get the misregistration part of their ability back after the Preacher dies?
A Yes.

Q The Town Crier can get a no if the Spy nominates, right?
A Yes.

-------------reword me
Q Is it okay to show the Washerwoman a Townsfolk who is not in play and point to the Spy and one other player?
A It is legal to do that with the Washerwoman and Librarian, and show no real Minions to the Investigator using the Recluse.
  This could be a good move for the ST when there is not a lot of other misinformation in play, for instance, no Drunk and no Poisoner.

=========
=Steward=
=========
Q What happens if the Steward's good player becomes evil later?
A Nothing. The Steward is a start knowing ability, not a constantly knows.

===============
=Storm Catcher=
===============
Q If the Boomdandy explodes, can the player favoured by the Storm Catcher die?
A No.  However, the Storm Catcher can be removed from play immediately before the Boomdandy execution and kill the previously storm caught character at will.

Q The Storm Catcher favours the Damsel ...?
A Do not storm catch the Damsel!

Q Do newly created evil players, such as the Demon jumping, learn the player favoured by the Storm Catcher?
A Yes.

Q Does the Marionette learn the player favoured by the Storm Catcher?
A It would probably be best not to, as otherwise that would tell the Marionette that they are evil.
  Good players do not learn about storm caught players, and the Marionette thinks they are good, so that kind of works.

============
=Sweetheart=
============
Q If a dead player becomes the Sweetheart (Pit-Hag / Barber swap / ...) is another player Sweetheart drunked for the rest of the game?
A No. 

  The Sweetheart's ability is a trigger on death, not a constant check of living status, as it states "when you die" not "whilst you are dead", so:
  * a player with the Sweetheart ability dies: another player is instantly drunked for the rest of the game
  * a dead player becomes the Sweetheart: no drunkening happens.

Q If the Sweetheart is resurrected (Al-Hadikhia) or swapped to a living player, so that there is now a living Sweetheart in the game, 
  does the player that they previously drunked become sober?
A Yes.

  Resurrected and swapped roles are treated as new instances of the role, so as a new instance of the Sweetheart, any drunkening by the previous instance ceases.
  If the new instance dies, then a player is drunked again.

==========
=Tea Lady=
==========
Q Can either of the Tea Lady's good neighbours die to the Moon Child?
A No.

  If both of the Tea Lady's neighbours are good then they cannot die to any ability except the Assassin's.

Q What happens if the Tea Lady has two good neighbors and a multikill demon (Shabaloth / Po / ...) attacks the Tea Lady and one or both of her neighbors?
  Does her protection go away when she is attacked or does it last that night until dawn?
A As soon as the Tea Lady dies, the protection disappears.
  The Demon's choice order matters though. If the protected TL neighbor is chosen first and then the TL is chosen, only the TL dies.
  But if the TL is chosen first, the protection is gone and the neighbor will also die.

Q If the Tea Lady's neighbours are a two good players, one of whom is a Traveller, can that Traveller be exiled?
A No, exile is death and the Tea Lady protects their neighbours from dying. The Traveller can leave the game, though.

Q Does the Tea Lady ability ignore neighbouring Travellers?
A No.

========
=Tinker=
========
Q Can the Tinker die by execution if they are protected, for example by a Tea Lady?
A No.

Q Can the Tinker die in the day due to their power?
A Yes, as long as they are able to die and are not protected by another ability.
  But although you can, but you probably should not.

  It is legal for the ST to kill the Tinker at the start of the day when night deaths are announced, to hide the fact that they died during the day.
  In BMR that can give the Godfather a kill or frame an Assassin kill if they were Innkept.

Q Suppose the Tinker cannot die at night due to Innkeeper protection,
  but the ST kills them immediately at dawn to make the town think they died at night.# 
  Is the ST obligated to specify whether or not they died "at night", which is something a lot of STs do?
A RAW the ST can wait a fraction of a second after announcing night deaths and then say the Tinker died,
  There is no need to specify if it was a night death or not.

============
=Town Crier=
============
Q If the Town Crier is dead during the day and resurrected the next night (Al-Hadikhia / Professor / ...),
  are they told if a Minion nominated the previous day?
A Yes.

==========
=Toymaker=
==========
Q Does the Demon get bluffs in a Teensyville game? 
A No bluffs and the evil team does not know each other.

  Unless it is a Teenysville script using the Toymaker fabled character, 
  which gives evil players their usual information but the Demon must skip attacking one night.
﻿
Q Does the Po choosing to charge satisfy the Toymaker's requirement that the Demon must choose not to attack at least once per game?
A Yes.

============
=Undertaker=
============
Q In a Riot game, does the Undertaker learn about all the execution in the day?
A The ST chooses one of the executees for the UT to learn about, not all of them.

Q If a player is executed then swaps character (Pit-Hag / Barber / Engineer / Hatter)
  what does the Undertaker see?
A They learn the player's role at the time of the execution.

  The Undertaker's ability is past tense: they learn what character was executed, not what character that player currently is.
 
Q The poisoned Recluse is executed, but is not poisoned when the UT's turn comes up in the night, what happens?
A The UT must see the Recluse.
  The UT evaluates the character not at the time that they wake but when the character died.
  So the ST has to take the answer at the moment of execution, which would have to be Recluse.

Q A player is executed and dies. Another dead player then breaks Cere madness. 
  Can the second player be executed for madness breaking and shown to the UT?
A No, the UT learns which character died by execution. If one player is already dead, the UT can only learn the one who died by execution, not either.

Q The Imp is executed, the Scarlet Woman kills the Hatter, and the former Imp becomes the Spy.  Could the Undertaker learn Fortune Teller?
A No, they must see Imp.  The Undertaker learns their character at the time of their execution, not what character that player currently is.

Q If the Recluse is executed, what does the Undertaker see?
A The Undertaker can see the Recluse as any of the Minions, the Imp or just the Recluse.

  The Undertaker can see the wrong role because roles like the Recluse and the Spy can misregister to other characters even when dead.
  
Q If the Drunk is executed, what does the Undertaker see?
A The Undertaker is shown the Drunk character token, not the token for the Townsfolk that the Drunk player thought they were.

Q If the Spy is executed, what does the Spy see?
A The Spy's ability allows her to register as good, even after death, so she could register to the Undertaker as the Spy, or as any Townsfolk or Outsider.



=============
=Vigormortis=
=============
Q Does the Vigormortis-killed Scarlet Woman become the dead Demon if the Vigor dies with 5+ alive?
A Yes, which could end the game.  Vigormortis and SW are not a great pairing.

Q If a living Minion gains another out of play Minion ability via the Plague Doctor,
  do they keep this second ability if killed by the Vigormortis?
A Yes.

Q If the Vigor killed Poisoner poisons the Vigormortis, does the Vigor kill that night?
A No.

Q Does an evil Apprentice killed by the Vigormortis retain their ability?
A No, they are not a Minion.

Q If the Vigormortis is changed to another Demon (Pit-Hag / Engineer / Hatter),
  what happens to Minions they previously killed?
A They lose their abilities and neighbouring Townsfolk are no longer poisoned.

Q If a Vigormorits killed Minion changes role (Pit-Hag / Engineer/ Hatter)
  does the Minion keep their ability?
A A Vigor killed Minion keeps their ability and continues to poison a neighbouring Townsfolk as long as they always remain a Minion.

  If they ever stop being a Minion, they lose their ability and stop poisoning a neighbour.

Q The Vigor kills their Pit-Hag. The dead Pit-Hag changes the Vigormortis to another Demon.
  Does the PH lose his ability due to the Vigormortis being no longer in play?
A Yes.  Additionally the ST still has a momentary ability to kill arbitrarily, so should probably signal the Demon change,
  because after that moment passes, the Pit-Hag's ability is gone again, so deaths are not arbitrary anymore. 

Q Would a Vigormortis-killed Pit-Hag that turns themself into a Townsfolk/Outsider fail to gain that ability?
A They would become that role and then no longer have an ability.

  "Minions you kill keep their ability" means that if the person killed by Vigor is not a Minion, or stops being one, they lose their ability.
  Notably, a Vigor-killed Minion can be changed into a different Minion character and continue to use that ability, because it is still a Minion ability.
  But once they become something that is not a Minion, their ability is gone, even if they later become a Minion again.

Q Is it okay to register the Recluse as a Minion when she is killed by the Vigor in order to poison a Townsfolk neighbour?
A Yes, that is allowed. Use with caution and consider if evil is already winning without the help.

----
Q If a Vigor who killed ther Minions previously, is snake charmered, do the Minions lose their ability?
A Yes, the Snake Charmer turned Vigor is a fresh instance of the Vigormortis who has not killed any Minions.
  The Vigormortis that was giving those dead Minions their abilities no longer exists, so its effect no longer exists either. 

Q Do Minions killed by the Vigormortis keep their power when the Vigormortis moves player due to the Snake Charmer? 
A No.  Character swaps essentially reset the characters; they are replaced with new instances of the characters.
  In this case the Vigormortis that was giving dead Minions their abilities no longer exists, so those Minions lose their abilities.

Q If the Vigor changes places (Snake Charmer, Barber, ...) do any Minions they have killed keep their ability?
  Does the new Vigor need to rekill the dead Minions?
A No. It is a new instance of the Vigor and this Vigor is not the one who killed those Minions. 
  And the new Vigormortis cannot "reactivate" their dead Minions' abilities by attacking their corpses, 
  because attacking an already dead player does not "kill" them.
--

Q What happens if a Vigor-poisoned Townsfolk becomes a different character type (e.g. pit-hagged into an Outsider)?
  What if a neighboring player being skipped by the poison becomes a Townsfolk?
A The target is no longer valid, so the poison must move to a new Townsfolk neighbour of the Vigor-killed Minion.
  This can still be in either direction from said Minion; reapply the poison to either of the closest Townsfolk neighbours.

Q If a Vigormortis kills a Minion, the Minion keeps its power and poisons one of their neighbours.
  Can a second kill (by another character or by execution) of that minion disable the Minion's power and the poisoning,
  or would it have no further effect and the Minion keeps their power and keeps poisoning their neighbour if killed a second time?
A It would have no further effect. 
  Vigormortis says "Minions you kill keep their ability" and executing a dead minion will not kill them
  as they cannot be killed, because they are already dead.
  For the rest of the game, while the Vigormortis lives and its ability applies, 
  they are dead because the Vigormortis killed them, and thus keep their ability even when killed again.
  (The power that makes the Minions keep their abilities is not the Minion's power but the Vigormortis’s power.)
  If there is a change of demon (either type or player) then the Minions will most likely lose their ability.
  
Q Does the Vigormortis-killed Alchemist keep her ability?
A No, she is not a Minion. The Alchemist has a Minion ability but is not actually one.

Q The Barber was killed by the Vigor, and swapped with the Evil Twin. Does the dead Evil Twin keep their ability? 
A No.
  A player must be a Minion at the time of the kill and remain a Minion the entire time for Vigor to work.
  It is okay to be swapped or pithagged into a different Minion, as long as they are never not a Minion inbetween.
 
  If a player died as the Barber, as in the example, they do not ever get to keep a Minion ability even if they become one later.

Q If the Vigormortis passes to the Scarlet Woman, do previously killed Minions keep their abilities?
A No. It is a new instance of the Vigor and this Vigor is not the one who killed those Minions.

Q If the Vigormortis becomes drunk, like say, from the Minstrel, do Minions they have killed regain their ability when made sober?
A Yes. It is a present-tense effect, so it is always in effect whenever the Vigor is sober and healthy.
﻿
Q Killing the Evil Twin as the Vigormortis loses the unwinnable condition,
 because the text says 'Good cannot win if you both live.' 
 However, if the Good Twin is executed while the Evil Twin has their ability because of the Vigormortis, does evil win?
A Yes.

===============
=Village Idiot=
===============
Q Can one of the Village Idiots be the Marionette?
A Sure, if they neighbour the Demon or the Recluse.
  If this leaves one true VI in play then that one must be sober.
  If it leaves two, one of them is drunk and the other one is sober.
  The Marionette VI is then run like any other Marionette.

  In order to guarantee the Marionete Village Idiot, an alternative setup of some sort is needed,
  such as substituting the Demon token in the bag with an extra Townsfolk, 
  then on N1 picking a Townsfolk neighbour of a VI to become the Demon.


========
=Virgin=
========
Q Could an evil Townsfolk (Bounty Hunter / Mezepheles / ...) trigger the Virgin?
A Yes.

Q What happens when the Virgin is first time nominated by a Townsfolk protected by the Tea Lady?
A The ST announces that the Townsfolk player is executed but does not die and starts the next night phase.

Q If a good Traveller nominates the Virgin will they be executed by the Virgin's ability?
A No. The Virgin only cares if it is specifically a Townsfolk. Alignment does not matter.
  A Traveller is not a Townsfolk, so no matter their alignment it will not work. It will still waste the Virgin's ability though. 

Q Is there another way that Townsfolk A nominates another player X and A becomes executed immediately, except X is a Virgin? 
  i.e. are there any situations for X to simulate the Virgin?
A i) Atheist game.
  ii) Breaking Cerenovus madness or Mutant madness while nominating could mimic that style of execution.

Q What happens when the first time the Virgin is nominated, it is done by a Witch-cursed Townsfolk?
A The Witch is given priority: the nominator dies and then their corpse is executed.
  The ST announces "X dies and is executed".
  The Undertaker (who only learns about those who die to execution) would not be woken that night.
  The Cannibal will not gain the ability of the nominator.
  This precedence makes the Witch a little stronger.

========
=Vizier=
========
Q The Vizier's ability reads "All players know who you are." Is the droisoned Vizier announced on the first day? Or can the ST make the Vizier believe they are sober/healthy by still announcing them?
A The Vizier remains unannounced (and cannot force through an execution and can die during the day) until they become healthy/sober.  
  
  Droisoned players can never affect the state of the game,
  even if that means they immediately realize they are droisoned.
  Maintaining the illusion for that one player is less important than maintaining the basic principle that droisoned players have no ability
  and therefore cannot affect the state of the game.
  So, the ST may lie to a player that their ability is working but may not lie to the town as a whole that a player’s ability is working.

Q If the Vizier is the Lleech host, are they unkillable?
A No. They are poisoned and have no ability.

Q If the Vizier is under madness and breaks the madness, is he executed?
A You can execute them as the ST, but they would not die. It is probably a bad idea to as it just wastes a day for the good team with no counterplay.

Q If the Vizier forces the execution of the Lleech who obviously does not die, will there more be executions that day or not?
A No, you have one execution per day and an execution will always immediately end the day (unless there is a Butcher)
  and there are never more executions after the first.

  A player can be executed without dying, and there are some abiltiies that work interestingly around this concept.
  It is why the Mutant's execution instantly ends the day or why Cannibal specifies "recently killed executee" rather than just "executee".

Q If the Vizier is D1 drunk, does that drunkness mean that the Vizier does not have to be announced? Should it be announced N2?
A Yes, and it would be announced the first time they are sober/healthy, same as the King.
  The how-to specifies the Vizier annoucement is during the day,
  so RAW it is possible a Poisoner or other sources of droison could keep a lock on the annoucement for a few days - similar to Leviathan
  but that is pretty risky if the Viz gets executed while evil is strategically holding off their announcement.

Q The Golem can kill the Organ Grinder but not the Vizier, correct?
A Correct. The Vizier cannot die during the day for any means, unless droisened.

Q Can the droisoned Vizier die to execution?
A Yes.

========
=Vortox=
========
Q Can the Lunatic learn true info in a Vortox game, this Minion is a Minion, the King is the King, ... ?
A Yes, the Lunatic as an Outsider is unaffected by the Vortox falsifying of info. It is up to the ST whether this is a good idea.

Q What does the Alchemist Evil Twin learn in a Vortox game?
A Loads!

  Firstly she is told wrongly that she has a different Minion ability, one that is actually in-play.
  Next she learns the wrong role of another good player as her evil-aligned twin,
  which will likely alert her to the fact that she has the Evil Twin ability.

  So she learns:
  * one of the in-play Minions,
  * a confirmed good player,
  * the Demon is a Vortox.

Q Does the Monk protected player receive true info in a Vortox game?
A Yes. They are safe from the Demon in all aspects, including secondary effects, assuming they are sober and healthy.

Q What are the Minions told when the Cannibal eats the Snitch in a Vortox game.
A Three in-play characters.

  Even though the Snitch is an Outsider, the Cannibal is a Townsfolk so any information ability that they gain is affected by the Vortox.
  So the Minions would each be told three in play characters due to the Cannibal-Snitch ability being a Townsfolk ability rather than an Outsider ability.

Q What does the Vortox learn if the Cannibal eats the Lunatic?
A The Vortox learns the wrong player as their Lunatic and the wrong players for the Lunatic's picks.

Q Does an evil Townsfolk (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter / ...) still receive false info in a Vortox game?
A Yes.

Q Does a sober, vortoxed Alchemist always have correct waking patterns?
A They are told the ability of an in-play Minion but are treated like the ability they actually have,
  which would be the ability of an out-of-play Minion. So they have the wake pattern of their actual ability.

Q The Alchemist Fearmonger in a Vortox game ...  does the ST announce that the Fearmonger has picked a new player?
A Yes.

  Public or even private announcements are not information.
  Only _who_ is information for the purposes of the Vortox.
  For example
  * preached Minions still learn they have been preached,
  * exorcised Demons still learn they have been exorcised (they just learn the wrong player),
  * the Philosopher-Damsel would still inform the Minions that the Damsel is in play.

  So the ST should still announce that the Fearmonger has selected a new player.

Q In a Vortox game what do Minions learn when they were chosen by the Preacher?
A That they were chosen by the Preacher, same as a non Vortox game, as being told that you were picked by a player is not part of the vortoxable information.
  If it were an ability were you learnt _who_ picked you (such as when the Exorcist picks the Vortox) then that would part would be falsified.

Q How does the Nightwatchman work in a Vortox game?
A The target of the Nightwatchman / Philo-Nightwatchman / Cannibal-Nightwatchman wakes up and learns they were picked by the Nightwatchman but is told the wrong name.

  The Vortox says Townsfolk abilities yield false info
  and the Nightwatchman, and other info passing characters too, are ruled that the ability name/type is not part of the vortoxable information -
  "someone with the NWM ability chose you" is a mechanical explanation of why someone woke up,
  and [ST points to a player] is the information.

Q Does the Soldier, who is safe from the Demon, correctly learn the Nightwatchman if picked in a Vortox game?
A No. The source of the information is the Nightwatchman and they are not safe from the Demon.

Q When a player is D1 executed but does not die, the Undertaker does not wake, but does the Oracle wake to learn whether it is a Vortox game?
A Yes.

Q The Philosopher picks the Damsel ability in a Vortox game.
  Do the Minions still learn the Damsel is in play?
A Yes.

  Being targeted by an ability (Damsel, Nightwatchman, Exorcist, Preacher, King, etc) is not falsified in a Vortox game,
  though any information that goes along with it would be
  (in the case of Nightwatchman, Exorcist, and King that is the learning of a player),
  though that does not apply to Damsel (even filtered through Philosopher), so they just simply learn the Damsel is in play.

Q How does the Pixie interact with the Vortox?
A The Pixie learns an out of play Townsfolk.
  An arbitrary player is marked whose role does not matter.  The marked player could in fact be a Minion, but probably should not be the Demon.
  If the marked player dies, the Pixie would gain the ability they were shown if they were sufficiently mad as that role.


Q The Magician Vortox interaction... does it work the same way as Philosopher Lunatic in a Vortox game, where the Demon learns a wrong name?
A No. 
  The Magician already gives false information because she appears as a Minion. So, with a Vortox or with another Demon, there is no difference.

Q Does the Noble have to see all good players in a Vortox game? Or can they see 2-3 evil players too?
A They can see anything but two good and one evil. Including all evil.

Q Is it possible to learn factual information in a Vortox game due to a character misregistering?
  For example where an Empath neigbors a Spy and a good player, the Spy register as good, therefore the Empath would learn a 0, but the vortox warps it into a 1?
A Yes.
  It was previously thought not, but since the ruling that the Fortune Teller's red herring yields a "no" in a Vortox game, 
  the majority (but not universal) view is that this generalizes to other kinds of misregistration, including Spy. 

Q Does the Grandmother's grandchild have to be an evil player in a Vortox game?
A No.
  The Vortox'd Grandmother has to learn one of player and character wrong for their grandchild.
  They can learn the right player wrong role, right role wrong player, etc.

  Notably, they do still have a good player as a grandchild and will still die if that player is killed by the Vortox,
  because that is a mechanical effect, which the Vortox cannot falsify.

Q Is the Gossip affected by the Vortox?
A No, the Gossip is not considered an info role. 

Q If the Vortox dies and the game continues for whatever reason,
  is the Vortox ability now nullified and thus all information reverts back to being true, barring droison?
A Yes. Since players lose their ability when dead, then the Vortox's ability of forcing false Townsfolk info is no longer in effect.

Q Would the Alchemist Pit-Hag in a Vortox game make people learn the wrong character?
  Or is that not 'information'?
  What about the Alchemist Cerenovus?
  What about Minions that make a public announcement like the Vizier and the Fearmonger,
  would the ST announce incorrect information?
A Learning your character and alignment is never "information" for the purposes of the Vortox.
  Learning what character you are mad as is not information. 

Q If in a Vortox game that contains both the Damsel and the Philosopher Damsel, what do Minions learn?
  Seems learning that the Damsel is in play would be true information derived from a Townsfolk ability (Philo)
  but learning a different character/nothing at all seems incorrect also.
A Minions learn that the Damsel is in play.

  Being woken due to an ability to learn <ability> affected you or is in play
  is a mechanical aspect not affected by Vortox; only learning specifically who is.
  
  Consider similar interactions in Vortox games:
  A Minion that is selected by the Preacher is still told that they have been preached.
  If the Demon is picked by the Exorcist, the Demon learns this but learns the wrong player.
  The demon learns that the King is in play, but not the correct person.

Q In a Vortox game, do you lie to the Amnesiac about their guesses?
  For example if they asked if their ability was to do with voting and it was not should you still give them a warm/hot?
A Yes.

Q If the Nightwatchman is in a Vortox game, the player chosen will be shown anybody, but the Nightwatchman, including a Minion.
  If the Preacher chooses a Minion in a Vortox game, does the Minion get the info their ability stops working or not?
  Is it a Townsfolk ability yielding false info?
A Being told one has been chosen by an ability does not get falsified with Vortox, so a Minion would learn they were chosen by the Preacher.
  If it is accompanied by learning a player, such as in your Nightwatchman example, or also, for example, Exorcist, then the player shown must be false.

---------------combine
Q The Poppy Grower dies in a Vortox game, what do the evils learn?
A At night you tell each evil player incorrect info.

Q In a Vortox game, if the Poppy Grower dies, can you give the evil team bad info?
A Rules as written, the information they receive from Poppy Grower (a Townsfolk) must be false.
  It is common to house rule this interaction.

  Worth noting that, while not a perfect workaround, showing wrong information can still mean showing the Demon as a Minion,
  and a Minion as the Demon. Arguably, you could show all of the Minions as Demons.

Q If the Poppy Grower dies in a Vortox game, does evil learn the wrong team?
A RAW, yes. The Demon learns player(s) who are not Minion(s), and the Minion(s) learn a player who is not the Demon. 

Q Do evil players learn good players in a Vortox game when the Poppy Grower dies?
A Almost correct.  The evil team learn false information because this information is coming from a Townsfolk ability, so the ST could show the Minions and the Demon good players.
  But, more specifically, they learn non-Minions as Minions and non-Demons as Demons. They could still be shown an evil Townsfolk for example, if one was in play.

  So in a two Minion game, the Minions could learn their fellow Minion as the Demon and the Demon as a fellow Minion,
  while the Demon would still have to learn two non-Minions, but as they are the Vortox they at least will know their info is wrong.
---

Q What does the Knight learn when the Vortox is in play?
A The Knight learns two players one of which is the (or possibly a) Demon.

Q Does the Philosopher Snitch and the Cannibal Snitch causes Minions to learn in play characters in a Vortox game?
A Yes.  Snitch may be an Outsider ability, but it is a Townsfolk character with that ability.

Q In a Vortox game, what should the Fortune Teller get when they hit their red herring?
A They would get a "No".

Q Can the Recluse create true info in a Vortox game?
  For example the Chef sees the Recluse as evil, so sees a pair where there is no pair, so learns there is no pair, which is true information despite the Vortox.
A It was previously ruled "no", but since the Vortox/FT ruling came out most people would say "yes". 

  The FT's red herring can cause them to get a "no" when they choose the red herring but not the demon (and a Vortox is in play). 
  It has been controversial, but the concensus is that this implies that the Vortox can flip information after accounting for misregistration.

Q How does the Bounty Hunter interact with Vortox misinformation?
A They learn a good player. When that good player dies, they learn another good player.
  Even if the Vortox is killed, droisoned, etc., the BH is only shown a new player after the death of the shown good player; 
  the BH never gets "corrected" info.
  They get shown a player and they will only ever get a new name when that player dies, regardless of that player's actual alignment.

Q Is the Apprentice immune to the Vortox due to being a Traveller, or does their Townsfolk ability still yield false info?
A Travellers get true information in a Vortox game.
  An Apprentice getting info from a Townsfolk ability is not a Townsfolk player, they are a Traveller player.

Q Can the Fibbin cause a Townsfolk to get true information in a Vortox game?
A It is not explicit one way or another, but does notably use the phrase "incorrect information"
  The Fibbin is probably not designed to do so since the idea is it is for scripts with no way for there to be false information,
  but it can be ruled otherwise.
  It could be a fun ruling that do not break anything so long as everyone understands the interaction

Q If the Fool does not die by execution for the first time, does it count as a succesful execution for the Vortox?
A Yes, any execution will satisfy the Vortox's condition, even if it does not lead to death.

Q How does the Vortox affect the Balloonist's information?
A Each Balloonist reminder token is placed next to a character that is not that character type,
  so the Balloonist basically just gets four arbitrary names.

  Note that the four names the Balloonist learns cannot be one Townsfolk, one Outsider, one Minion and one Demon.

Q What does the Alchemist, a Townsfolk role, learn in a Vortox game? / Is the Alchemist immune from the Vortox?
A The Alchemist learns an in play Minion, but has the ability of an out-of-play Minion,
  as the Vortox causes misinformation but does not change the ability's working.
  Note that the Alchemist, although they have a Minion ability, is still a Townsfolk and is not immune to the Vortox.

  So for example in a game with the Witch and the Poisoner in play and the Harpy and the Devil's Advocate on the script,
  the Alchemist learns that they have the ability of the Poisoner while in reality they have the DA's ability. 
  The ST still has to maintain the DA's restriction on not picking the same player twice in a row. 

Q Would an Alchemist with the Spy or the Widow ability see an incorrect grimoire in a Vortox game?
A The Alchemist cannot have the Spy or the Widow ability as they are jinxed combinations. 

Q In a Vortox game, the Alchemist has a passive Scarlet Woman ability, but thinks she has the Poisoner ability. Should she be woken every night?
A No.
  It is not the same as a 'you think' like the Drunk or the Marionette who are constantly lied to.
  She should just got false information at the start,
  so N1 she is told an incorrect ability but then treated like she would be for her actual ability.

Q In a Vortox game, the Alchemist is told that they have the Godfather's ability (an information gathering Minion),
  when in reality they have a different Minion ability (say some passive Minion like Boomdandy or Scarlet Woman).
  What do they learn regarding Outsiders?
A The Alchemist is just told that they have the Godfather ability, but then nothing else because they do not actually have the Godfather ability.

Q In a Vortox game, what does the Alchemist Godfather learn?
A She falsely learns that she has a different Minion ability, that is in play.  She is then shown out of play Outsiders.

Q What do you tell the Savant in a Vortox game?
A The Savant is given two false statements.

Q Does the Vortox learn of the King or the Exorcist?
A The Vortox correctly learns that the Exorcist / King are in play but always learns the wrong person.

Q Who must the Monk protect for the Nightwatchman's pick to correctly learn the Nightwatchman in a Vortox game?
A The Nightwatchman, because they are the source of the information.

  In a Vortox game, the Nightwatchman picks a player, and that player learns someone else as something other than the Nightwatchman.
  The Monk protection can stop the Vortox from making info false,
  but in order for the the target to learn the correct player as the Nightwatchman,
  it is the Nightwatchman as the source of the ability that needs to be protected when they use their ability, not their target.
  If the target is Monk-protected then the misinformation is not prevented.

Q D1, a Minion is executed while the Minstrel is in play, so the Vortox is drunk. If on D2 no one is executed, does the evil team win?
A ST choice; it could go either way.

  Two actions are stated to occur at dusk and would attempt to happen at the same time:
  *At dusk tomorrow, all players made drunk by the Minstrel become sober; the ST removes the EVERYONE IS DRUNK reminder.  
  *Each dusk, if no player was executed today, the game ends and the evil team wins.

  This is an order of operations issue.  Whichever happens first loses the interaction.

  One interpretation:
  The Vortox will be drunk until dusk. 
  The day ends with no execution, then dusk happens, so the Vortox is still drunk at the point they otherwise would have won.
  They do not become undrunk until that start of the night phase.
  The game continues.

  Alternative interpretation:
  First the Minstrel's tokens are removed, then we check the Vortox wincon. Evil wins.

  Given that the Vortox was drunk up until literally that moment, arguably it makes more intuitive sense that they would fail to win the game.

=======
=Widow=
=======
Q When does the Widow get to poison in a Poppy Grower game?
A After the PG dies and they see the grim for the first time; they do not get to poison blind N1, not even themselves.
  This means that the Widow announcement is guaranteed to go out on their first night.

Q Does the Widow get to see first night information reminder tokens when they view the grim?
  For example, if the Washerwoman was going to see the Soldier, should those tokens be placed before the first night,
  or directly before the WW step; is that information that the Widow gets to know?
A Anything that looks at the Grim sees what the ST has in there.
  Most STs choose to leave those tokens in, but they technically do not have to.

Q If the good player who saw the Widow ping turns evil, and the Widow still has their ability, does a new good player get the ping?
A Yes.

  "If the good player who knows the Widow is in play turns evil while the Widow is alive, wake a new good player and show them the Widow character token." - from Widow how to run 

Q The Pit Hag creates the Widow.  Does the Widow see the grim that night or the next?
A That night; it is their first night.  They should be immediately woken and shown the grim.

  Note that the Widow is not an info role that must wait for poisoners and killers to act first.
  They have a mechanical ability that lets them see the Grim and poison someone as soon as they come into play.

Q If the Widow is created mid-game (Engineer picking the Minions / Pit-Hag / Hatter / ...) when does a good player get told?
A A good player learns of the Widow that night.

=========
=Zombuul=
=========
Q If the once-killed Zombuul is drunked or poisoned, does the game end?
A The game continues because importantly the Zombuul has never actually died.
  Their death shroud is not removed and nothing is announced to town.
  They do not register as dead for roles like Tea Lady and Oracle that care about living status.
 
Q If the Zombuul that has not already died once is killed while droisoned, what happens?
A The droisoned Zombuul dies for real even if they have not used their extra life.

Q If the Zombuul loses its first life, would an Oracle's number rise by one? 
A Yes.

Q In a Zombuul game, if a dead player is executed again, would the Zombuul wake the following night to kill?
A Yes, the Zombuul's ability checks whether a player died.

Q The first time a Zombuul is executed, do they still wake at night to kill, if no other player dies that day,
  or does being executed technically count as "died today” even though they live?
A They count themselves as having died today and do not wake.

Q If a dead player becomes the Zombuul (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Engineer /...) do they return to life as a once-killed Zombuul?
A No, they are the genuinely dead Zombuul.

  It is only the Zombuul's ability that allows it to misregister as dead that gives them a second life,
  and dead players do not have abilities unless specified otherwise.

Q Is the once-killed Zombuul who either swaps with a Minion (Barber) or becomes another Demon (Pit-Hag / Engineer / Hatter)
  just the dead version of her new character?
A No, she is alive but remains appearing as dead.
  Nothing in the ability prompts the ST to announce anything about her life/death status
  since her status has technically not changed.
  As a result the town do not know to flip her life token back over:
  in person, the town square is maintained by the players, not the ST,
  and online the ST simulates what the players would do.
 
  From the players' perspective nothing has changed,
  but abilities that care about living status are affected: she does not register as dead, so abilities can see, choose and impact her.

 The Zombuul and roles that allow character changes such as Barber or the Pit-Hag do not mix well! It is kind of awkward no matter how it is run.

Q Does the "dead" Zombuul have a ghost vote?
A Yes.

Q Can the "dead" Zombuul vote more than once?
A After their first vote while registering as dead they would lose their ghost vote.
  Mechanically they can vote again but voting more than once while appearing dead would out them, so probably a bad idea.
  Some STs would rule that the Zombuul cannot vote again and would not count any ghost votes after the first.

:Fang Gu / Pit-Hag:  
  
Q If the Pit-Hag creates a Fang Gu and the arbitrary kill at night kills an Outsider, is it supposed to be that the Fang Gu jumps? 
  I believe not but it has happened in a game where the fang gu did in fact jump
  (a single player died that night and that was the fang gu who turned an outsider into the new fang gu)
A If the Fang Gu themselves targeted that Outsider, the ST can choose to allow the kill to go through and thus the Fang Gu to jump.
  The ST can also choose to block the Fang Gu's choice of an Outsider and have them die to the Pit-Hag with no jump.

  Or, of course, the ST can block the kill entirely and not kill the Outsider to either ability.

  If the Fang Gu did not target an Outsider, they cannot jump - if that Outsider dies, it is only to the Pit-Hag's ability and not to the Fang Gu's.


Q In SnV, the starting demon is the No-Dashii and the Pit-Hag turns the Cerenovus into a Fang Gu.
  The new Fang Gu picks an outsider.

  Due to the PH creating a new demon, deaths are arbitrary.
  Does this mean that the jump cannot occur? 
  Or would it be legal to e.g. wake up town with the No-Dashii and the original Fang Gu dead, and the outsider now being the alive evil Fang Gu?

A Demon selections still go through, with any arbitrary protections or deaths occurring from the Pit-Hag, so you do not have to abide by the demon's choices.

  It would therefore be valid for the Fang Gu’s jump to be processed as per usual,
  with the newly created Demon dead and the Outsider converted, on top of an arbitrary No Dashii death.

  In full, the ST's options are:

  # The Fang Gu kills the Outsider, so the "jump" happens
     - the normal demon kill goes through; any other deaths are due to the PH.
  # The Fang Gu does not kill the Outsider, so no "jump" and the Outsider remains alive
     - the PH's "deaths are arbitrary" ability
  # The Fang Gu does not kill the Outsider, but the Pit-Hag does, so the Outsider dies but there is no "jump"
     - the PH's "deaths are arbitrary" ability
 
  However, you could not legally kill the Fang Gu and have some other random unselected Outsider converted instead.

Q If the Pit-Hag creates the Fang Gu and then the Fang Gu chooses an Outsider at night, and the ST allowes his kill to go through,
  does this also make the Fang Gu jump? Does the kill come from the Pit-Hag's ability or not?
A Either. The way Pit-Hag arbitrary deaths works is that the ST can block any kills (or not), and can cause new kills originating from the Pit-Hag.
  If the ST allows the Fang Gu kill to go through, it jumps. If they prevent it but then kill that player anyway with the Pit-Hag ability, then there is no jump. 


Q If the Pit-Hag changes the Demon into the Fang Gu, can the Fang Gu jump that same night?
  Does the Demon's choice matter at all that night or, because of the Pit-Hag's deaths are arbitary ability, are all deaths caused by the Pit-Hag instead of the Demon?
A They can if the Storyteller allows it...ST's options are as follows, assuming the new Fang Gu chooses an Outsider when deaths are arbitrary:

  # the chosen Outsider is protected and does not die
  # the chosen Outsider is protected and does not die, but then dies from the Pit-Hag (no jump)
  # the chosen Outsider dies from the Demon (jump happens) 

  "Deaths are arbitrary" means the ST can allows deaths go go through, or not go through.
  So if the ST allows the Demon's choice to go through, that one is an attack from the Demon, not the PH,
  and if the ST blocks it, then it is treated similarly to the player being protected from the demon that night.
  Any "additional" deaths are considered attacks from the PH.

:droisoning:

Q If the Preacher was drunk when he chose a Minion, will that Minion be preached when the Preacher becomes sober?
A No.  Mechanical abilities used while drunk have no effect on other players.

Q If a player that wakes at night is drunk / poisoned, could the ST just skip them?
A Droisoned players are never skipped. The ST should deceive them that their abilities are functioning normally.


----Needs editing
Q Reminder tokens are placed/removed regardless of drunkenness or poisoning:
  * a drunk Juggler will still place "correct" reminder tokens,
  * a drunk Gossip will still place its "dies tonight" token,
  * a Minstrel will still place its "everyone drunk" token, etc.

  The drunkenness/poisoning simply disables the ability that makes these tokens do anything.

  So what happens when the normal flow of an ability (place when needed, remove when checked at night phase) is interrupted, such as by droisoning or by a character change?
A A more broad rule of thumb:
  If the player was drunk/poisoned at the time of their ability then a token is not placed,
  and if no token is placed then it cannot "come back."

  If a token was placed and that is interrupted by drunk/poison and then the drunk/poison goes away,
  then the effect of the token comes back.

  However, backward looking roles are run differently,
  with their tokens placed down for the ST's benefit.
  Abilities like the Juggler, Gossip, Mathematician, Town Crier, and Flower Girl have reminder tokens
  that essentially do not actually take effect until the night phase
  and putting them down during the day is just to make the night easier for the ST.
  That is why the ST still tracks them,
  because when the info/mechanical part of their ability truly goes off,
  they need to know in case the character is not drunk/poisoned.
  It does not matter if they were droisoned when the tokens were being placed,
  as long as they are sober and healthy at the time they get their info, it will be correct.
  Conversely, if they were sober and healthy when the tokens were placed, 
  and droisoned at the time of getting their info, the info is arbitrary.

Q In a Poppy Grower game, the Vigor-killed Poisoner poisons the Vigormortis.  What happens?
A Endless drunk/pison loops are resolved by having all parties drunked/poisoned, until one effect wears off as it normally would.
  In this situation,  both the Poisoner and the Vigor are poisoned, and the poisoned Townsfolk is temporarily healthy while the Poisoner remains poisoned.

Q If a character who normally wakes every night becomes droisoned, can the ST just NOT wake them? Or does the ST have to lie to them?
A You should never mechanically confirm that someone is currently drunk or poisoned. You have to wake them up and do whatever they expect you to do with their character.

Q The Marionette has a special case for when the Preacher picks them that their ability stops working
  and the ST pretty much ignores them at night since thinking they are a Townsfolk is their ability.
  Could the same logic apply to the Drunk being poisoned or the Lunatic being droisoned? 
  Or would that be too powerful and against the never reveal the Drunk unofficial rule?
A With drunkenness and poisoning, the goal is for the ST to still pretend their ability is still working,
  which for the Drunk means still pretending that they are the Townsfolk they think they are
  so drunk and poison are not very similar to being preached.

Q If a player is drunk and they receive info at night, does the ST have to wake them and give them info?
A Yes, that is what the ST would do if they were sober and healthy.
  The ST must convince them that their ability is functioning as normal.

Q Are there any characters that can make players sober and/or healthy? 
A Barista 1
  The Beggar makes herself sober and healthy.
  The Monk can protect from/remove Demon specific sources,
  not just when the Demon attacks, but also passive poison. They temporarily remove No Dashii or Lleech poisons for that night. 

Q Can the poisoned Demon kill people? 
A No. Poisoned characters have no ability.

Q What would happen if someone who is drunk gets posioned?
A No real difference as they do the same thing.
  They do not stack but it is still important to track both in case one ends before the other. They are sometimes even used interchangably as "droisoned"

Q Poisoned is similar to drunk right?
A Poisoning and drunkeness mechanically work the same. 
  If an ability makes a player drunk or it makes a player poisoned, it has the same effect. 
  So, information is arbitrary and mechanical based abilities do not work at all.
  
  Being drunk and being poisoned are technically different for the purposes of Savant statements and Artist questions,
  although usually those would involve saying "drunk or poisoned” to catch all cases.

Q If the Poisoner poisons the Minstrel, and the Poisoner is executed, is there a Minstrel night?
  Same for Widow too.
  Does the poison wear off before the Minstrel sees that a Minion died?
A This is a question of simultaneity, and there is no official answer.
  A valid interpretation is that at the moment the Minstrel sees the Poisoner as dead,
  they are not poisoned (because the Poisoner is dead), so the Minstrel procs.

Q If a character that is drunking or poisoning someone is changed into a different character, does the droisoning stay?
A No, because the ability that caused the droisoning no longer exists.
  
  Examples:
  * If the Imp self kills and the Poisoner becomes the new Imp, then the Poisoner is no longer in play and is therefore not poisoning anyone.
  * If the Pit-Hag turns the Philosopher drunking the Savant into the Mutant, then the Philo is no longer in play and is therefore not drunking the Savant.
  * If the Pit-Hag turns the Puzzlemaster into the Klutz, the previously Puzzlemaster-drunk player is now sober.

Q If a character is poisoned, they become healthy if the character that is causing them to be poisoned no longer has an active ability. 
  How does this apply to a Snake Charmer, or does it not?
A The SC poisoned by another character would become healthy if the other character was drunked, poisoned or dead. 
  If the SC poisons themselves, infinite poison loops are resolved by applying the poison.

Q Can poisoning reapply? If a Courtier chooses the Imp but is poisoned on the second night of their ability, is the Imp sober or drunk on the third night of the ability?
A If droison would be applied while the character is themselves droisoned, it is not.
  If the ability was applied while sober and healthy, the reminder token is flipped upside down, 
  the target is temporarily sober/healthy and when the droisoner regains their ability, it continues to apply.
  So in this example the Imp is made drunk once again for the third night of the Courtier's ability.

Q If the poisoned Philosopher "uses" their ability to gain another ability, and later gets healthy again,
  do they have the functioning ability of their character of choice, or did they never use their ability? 
A Any once per game ability used while poisoned is spent, the Philosopher is no exception:
  their attempt to aquire an ability does not work and spends their OPG ability and, for as long as they remain droisoned,
  the ST should pretend the ability they received works, but once they are healthy the ST can no longer deceive them.

  In a reverse scenario, if the Philo was sober/healthy when they picked (so they gain the ability)
  but then became droisoned they may receive false info or their mechanical ability does not work,
  until they are sober/healthy again (when the ability will resume functioning normally).
  While droisoned the ST could even stop waking them up and pretend they were poisoned at the time they used their OPG ability
  (but if they become healthy, they would have to start waking them again).

Q What if the Philosopher is sober when they choose an ability, but they are drunk when they use it?
A They have gained the ability. While drunk/poisoned, they may receive false information or a mechanical ability does not work at all.
  When they are sober/healthy again, they go back to working normally.

Q If the Philosopher is drunked or poisoned, does the Philo drunk player get sober?
A Yes.



:The Demon:
Q Can Demons choose dead players?
A Yes.

Q Can a Demon ever learn evil characters as bluffs?
A No, the Demon must learn three good out-of-play characters.

Q About the three Demon bluffs, do all three characters have to be Townsfolk or can they include Outsiders?
  Could one of the bluffs be whatever the Drunk believes they are?

A The Demon receives three good characters that are not in play at the start of the game, to avoid double claiming with a good player.
  As long as the bluffs are for not in play good characters, everything is legal.  Two Townsfolk and one Outsider is a pretty common approach.

  It is not recommended to show the character the Drunk thinks they are, but it is certainly not illegal; 
  it might be something to try with experienced players, perhaps to signal to the Demon who the Drunk is.

Q If a new Demon is made, do they learn about the Marionette / Lunatic / King?
A A new Demon learns anything the Demon "knows" (Mario, King, etc.) that is currently still in play and active when they are created that they have not already been informed of. 

Q The Philosopher N1 takes on a role not in game. Since the Philosopher's turn comes before the Demon gets their bluff,
  is it correct to say that the Demon cannot get the role the Philosopher took as a bluff, since that role is in play?
A The Philo's pick has no affect on Demon bluffs.
  The Philo only ever gains the ability, she does not turn into the character, so the character remains out of play.

  Any character out of play on setup can be given as a bluff,
  and if the Philo chose one of those bluffs then it is just unlucky for evil if they do not pretend to have poisoned info.
  
  The Philo is before N1 evil info just so that she can take the Poppy Grower or Magician abilities which would affect evil info.

Q If the demon is poisoned N1, can he get bad bluffs?
A No, because getting bluffs in not due to the Demon's character ability, and so cannot be disabled by poison.

Q The Demon and the Minions do not know each other's specific roles to begin with, do they? As in, the Demon does not know Dave is the Baron, only that he is a Minion.
A Correct.

:voting:

Q In case of the Cult Leader starting a cult, are all good players supposed to vote including the dead players, or only the alive ones?
A Including dead players.
  Cult forming (like exiling travellers) is not a regular vote.  Dead players are included and dead votes are not used.
  Abilities that specify executions (e.g. Flowergirls) are not triggered.
  An organ grinder is not triggered.
  Only votes for execution count as votes for abilities per the glossary.

Q A call to exile a Traveller, the Demon votes.  Is the Flowergirl informed?
A No. Exiles are not executions: They do not require or use a vote token (and, as such, require the normal full majority),
  do not end the day, and do not interact with any abilities that specify executions.

Q Does the Flower Girl read the Cult Leader votes as well as votes from nominations?
A No, the Cult Leader does not use votes, only raised hands.


:player conduct:
Q Would you allow the evil team to openly and loudly communicate their plans during the night phase in crucial game-winning moments?
A Sure, there is no rule against it.

-----------------reword
Q What can players say during the night phase?
A You can say whatever you want but with a few exceptions like not narrating what actions you do at night or saying that you did not wake up till the morning after.
  But if you want to give someone advice what to do at night based on info that was known the previous day absolutely do that,
  or as a minion lean over to your demon and tell them who they should kill.



:travellers:
Q In a game with multiple Demons (Legion / Riot / ...) what does an evil Traveller learn?
A They learn just one Demon player.

Q In a Lil' Monsta game does an evil Traveller still learn the babysitter if they are a good player at the time?
A Yes.

Q If a Traveller joins the game is their role immediatelly known to everyone or is it secret?
A Everyone knows what Traveller they are for as long as they are a Traveller.

Q Do exiled Travellers get a deadvote?
A Yes.

Q Can Travellers deadvote?
A Yes, after exile they have one dead vote like other dead players.

Q Can the Tea Lady protect a Traveller from exile?
A Yes. Exiles are death, and the Tea Lady protects her neighbours from death.

Q Can the Pacifist save a Traveller from exile?
A No. The Pacifist can save a player from dying to execution, and exiles are not executions.

Q Can the Devil's Advocate save a Traveller from exile?
A No. The DA can save a player from dying to execution, and exiles are not executions.

Q If a Traveller breaks Cerenovus madness, would they be exiled?
A No, they would be executed ending the day.

-------------reword
Q Do Travellers count as players for end of game? If there is a Demon, a good Outsider, and a Traveller left in the day, is the game over? 
A No, Travellers do not count towards the end of game player count. The example situation is a game over.
  Travellers do not count towards the living count for final three purposes.
  Travellers do not count for the win condition.

Q Do Travellers count for the purpose of evil's end game condition of surviving to final two?
A No.

  For example, if a Traveller, the Demon and one other player are left alive, then evil wins.
-----------------

Q Do Travellers count for the King's ability?
A Yes, same as with votes, they always count for the total player alive number except for evil's win condition.

Q Do Travellers count as alive players for the Chambermaid ability?
A Yes.

Q If a Traveller voted on a nomination prior to their exile on the same day, does their vote still count?
A The votes for a nomination are immutable as soon as they are recorded by the ST.

  The Exiled Traveller's votes prior to their exile still count for that day.
  An exiled Traveller is still in the game, they are just dead.
  and they have one vote from the time they died, the same as any other dead player.

Q Does the Demon learn if a Traveller who has just joined is on their team? 
A No, the Demon never learns the alignment of a Traveller.
  An evil Traveller, however, does learn who the Demon is,
  so they can go ahead and tell the Demon as much
  though the Demon may not believe them - they could just be good and fishing!

Q What happens if the Apprentice Philosopher Snake Charmer chooses the real Demon?
A By default, nothing, because normally a Traveller cannot become a non-Traveller, which makes the Snake Charmer a poor choice for the Apprentice.
  However, if an optional rule mentioned in the rulebook that players can become Travellers and vice versa is used,
  then the Apprentice would become the Demon and publicly lose their Traveller status
  and the Demon would become the Apprentice, which everyone would know and ultimately makes Snake Charmer a poor choice for the Apprentice.
  A good example of why Apprentice is recommend for Bad Moon Rising and not Sects and Violets.

Q Can a good Traveller become a Farmer?
A Under standard rules Travellers cannot change characters so an alive good Traveller cannot become a Farmer.
  However, if the variant where this is legitimate is used, 
  then when a Travaller becomes a Farmer their life token in the town square is changed from a Traveller one to a standard one.

Q Do evil Travellers learn the Demon in Teensyville?
A Yes, but Travellers in a Teensy is pretty unbalanced.

Q Why are Travellers not recommended for six players?
A They are not really recommended for seven or less because at those numbers, the Traveller's ability/alignment may have too much of an impact balance-wise,
  and the game will be going pretty quickly anyway. 

Q Can Travellers be targeted by the Demon at night?
A Yes. Any ability that says players includes Travellers unless stated otherwise like Dreamer.

Q Can players pick Travellers with their abilities?
  e.g. can the Witch choose Travellers?
A Yes, if the ability just states player any player is valid. Any abilities that do not allow Travellers being chosen will specify it
  e.g. Dreamers cannot choose travellers.

Q If a Traveller is exiled, do they still retain a place in the circle affecting neighbors? 
A Yes. If they travel away, on the other hand, then they actually leave the game.

Q If a Traveller is exiled, do they still have a dead vote?
A Yes.

Q Do Travellers count towards the majority needed to execute?
A Yes.

Q If a Traveller with an ability that effects setup (like an Apprentice Ballonist or Apprentice Baron) is in the game during setup,
  do their setup effects happen?
A Yes.


:misc:
Q After a player dies the ST does not reveal their identity, but is the dead player allowed to make their role public during the day phase?
A Anyone can say anything at any time including the dead.

Q Evil wins if only two players are alive.  What if there are only evil players alive?
A The game can end if there is no reasonable path to victory for good such as only evil left alive.

Q Can an Outsider be the Drunk?
A An Outsider can be drunk but they cannot be _the_ Drunk, as the Drunk must believe that they are a Townsfolk.

Q Is it allowed to drunk Outsiders with roles such as the Puzzlemaster, Innkeeper, Sailor and Sweetheart?
A Yes, but the ST probably should prioritise drunking Townsfolk when they can.

Q An evil player approaches the ST and informs her of what he is bluffing as, just in case he is Dreamer picked. Is that okay?
A Not only is this acceptable, it should be encouraged.
  Players can tell the ST whatever they want and it is up to the ST whether they use that.

  Evil players have a better chance if they communicate their plans to the ST.
  With roles such as Dreamer, Ravenkeeper and Undertaker, especially when droisoning happens, the ST will want to use what they learn,
  and it really helps to build plausible deceptions.

  Good players can, and often should, also tell the ST their plans and information; they are allowed to scheme as much as evil players.

Q Player A is made mad that player B is evil.  
  Another player suspects A is mad and asks her to prove if she is mad or not by saying something that could get her executed for breaking madness.
  Would saying something like "I am mad that player B is evil" count as breaking madness, despite her keeping madness the rest of the time?
A The ST should not consider this a madness break.
  
  Player A is doing that in an attempt to convince the town that they are not mad, and the intent and sincerity of their madness is still retained 
  Intent matters a lot more for madness than the words someone says

  The group might want to address this issue together as asking someone who is mad to break it to prove that they are mad runs against the spirit of madness.
  
  All madness related abilities, except for Pixie, are phrased with "might" to stop the evil team from exploiting 
  forced executions from the Cerenovus and forced deaths from the Harpy
  in ways which go against the spirit of the characters
  With the Mutant the "might" is used to ensure that it functions as an Outsider by making the execution happen at an inconvenient time for good.

Q Does the game end if the Demon is on the block, but then only two players remain alive, due to for example the Gunslinger?
A Yes. The game ends with evil winning in that situation.

Q If a character causes an effect on another character, such as protection against the Demon, drunkenness, or poison,
  and if that character that inflicts the effect is dead for whatever reason, does the effect disappear immediately?
A All effects and abilities discontinue when a character dies or is no longer in the game
  (unless the death causes the effect or the ability and/or effect continues through death),
  so any reminders belonging to a dead character can safely be removed.

Q If a player dies and is resurrected later in the same night, would the Storyteller announce that it happened?
A No, it would be as if the player did not die, at least outwardly.
  If they had a start knowing ability, then it would happen again, or if they had already used their once per game ability, they would get it back.

Q When do 'you start knowing' roles get their info when mid-game they are created / regurgitated / resurrected / picked by the Philosopher / eaten by the Cannibal?
A After droisoners and killers act.  There is always a chance that the Demon kills them or the Poisoner poisons them before they receive their info.

Q If a player with first night info is resurrected/regurgitated/etc., and they get woken again,
  do they learn new info matching their character description, or does it stay the same?
A ST choice. 

  For example a resurrected Grandmother is treated as a new Grandmother and can get a new grandchild.
  If a new one is assigned, only the new grandchild being killed by the demon triggers her death.
  Additionally, the new grandchild could be dead, protecting the Grandmother from being able to trigger their own death.
  
  For other first night info characters, if the info has not changed, they should technically be wakened and given the same info.
  It matters for several reasons, including droison, dying later, or being checked by the Chambermaid.

Q If the Demon is dead and the Evil Twin alive, evil wins the game if the good twin is executed.
  But why would this not lead to a tie? By executing the good twin, good has resolved the twin pair, and the Demon is dead, creating a tie. Should good then win? 
A Ability trumps over general game rule.
  So if two abilities cause a game tie, then the good one will win. If there is an ability game end condition and a regular game end condition, the ability wins out. 
  If two regular game end conditions are met at once, it is a tie and good wins.
  There are some exceptions for if it is impossible for one team to win, but the Evil Twin in SnV is not one of them.

Q In a six player game there is already one Outsider,
  but if the Baron is added and there is only one other Outsider on the script,
  such as is the case with No Greater Joy,
  is only one more Outsider added?
A Yes.
  In general, there can only be a maximum of the amount of Outsiders that are on the script, because players cannot have duplicate tokens.
  So even if there is Outsider modification that equals up to having six total Outsiders in play, if the script only has four Outsiders on it, only four would be in play.
  This does not come up in most scripts though;
  the Baron in a six player Teensy with only two Outsiders on the script is probably where the limit being hit is most often seen.

Q What exactly are jinxes?
A Jinxes are official special rules indicated by the Djinn fabled that fix issues or weird interactions between two characters
  that make one character useless, OP, or nonsensical due to the other.
  The rules are modified slightly so they work together properly or make the game more fun.
  The BotC app puts in the Djinn automatically for scripts with jinxes and it cannot be removed.
  
  The ST cannot create jinxes but they can create house rules.

Q If a first night character gets revived, when are they shown their info?
A They get their new "starting” info after the poisoning and killing roles get to act.

  The Professor already acts after the poisoning and killing roles act,
  so if the Professor revives a night 1 role, they get their info immediately. 

  A dead N1 role may be revived by the Al-Hadikhia but then die again because all three chosen players picked live. 

  An Al-Hadikhia or Shabaloth revived N1 role may also be sniped by the Assassin or other killing role before getting their new info.

Q A "gained" ability disappears when the ability that caused the player to gain it leaves play, right?
  So the Cannibal eating the Philosospher and choosing the Pixie would not keep the Pixie ability after another execution.
A Correct, once the Cannibal gains a new ability, they lose the Philosopher ability meaning they lose the Pixie ability.

Q Could more than one person get the same token, such as the Marionette and the Drunk both receiving the same Townsfolk token?
A This is not possible in an official capacity without the Bootlegger Fabled character in play
  and would require putting the same token in multiple times.
  If intending to use the Marionette to pull this off then it also needs one of those tokens to fall next to the Demon (or Recluse),
  or using the Gardener Fabled to assign characters.

Q Is multiple madnesses just a death sentence? 
  e.g. The Mutant, made Cerenovus-mad as an Outsider, is just dead no matter what they do?
A It is a tricky situation for the Mutant for sure but is up to the ST,
  who possibly might consider the game state, on whether to execute or not.

Q If a player dies and is revived in the same night, is their death and undeath announced?
A No. The ST only announces visible changes to a player's life/death status.
  So if Town went to sleep with someone alive, and they wake up with someone alive, they do not learn anything.

Q Do dead Characters register for abilities that say "in play"?
A Players who are dead are still their character, and so are still "in play".

Q Are dead characters still in play for the purpose of the Philosopher and the Pit-Hag?
A Yes. The token is assigned to a player; therefore the character is in play.

Q If a character with a one time use ability uses it and then dies later in the game and then is revived do they get the ability back?
A Yes. Even though it says 'once per game' it is a new instance of the character and it is as if the game has reset for them.

Q Can someone die (due to the Tinker, Slayer, Cerenovus, Harpy, .. ) during a vote? Must it wait until after?
  It feels like active abilities might make sense to be paused during a vote, but is this an official rule?
A Yes, players can die during a vote, nothing really stops that...
  on a practical level, it is unlikely for the Storyteller to do as they are busy spinning around in a circle counting votes.

Q Does a resurrected player get a ghost vote if they used it while dead the first time?
A Yes, each time a player dies they a ghost vote token.

Q What happens if the game gets to a final two with a good Demon and a Townsfolk?
A Evil wins.
 
Q If two characters ever have the same night ability, is there an order for which activates first?
A No, because certain examples of this can cause issues if run one way, and others cause issues if run the other way.
  The ST should use their best judgement to choose the order that is least likely to cause a severe disruption to the game state.

Q If someone dies during the day (Harpy / Tinker / Witch / ...), does this change the number of required votes,
  and can this put people on the block who were previously safe,
  having just gotten not quite enough votes before those players died?
A It does change the vote amount required, but any vote still needs to have more than any other vote in order to go on the block.
  This does not impact votes that have already happened - whether someone is on the block or not is determined immediately in that moment.
  
  For example, if player X gets five votes and that is not enough and then people die and five would be enough now, player X is still safe,
  and another player would still need at least six votes in order to be put on the block.

Q In a base zero Outsiders game with a Vigor (-1 Outsiders) and Sentinel (+1 Outsiders) in play, can there be an Outsider?
A There can be, but most STs will do cumulative outsider modification, not sequential,
  which means there could not be an Outsider with only the Sentinel and the Vigor in play.
  While Outsider modification is allowed to be sequential most players tend to prefer cumulative.
