=Acrobat=
=========
Q Can the drunk or poisoned Acrobat die with one or more drunk or poisoned neighbours?
A No.  The Acrobat dies only at its turn in the night order. If they are drunk/poisoned at that time, they would not be able to die to their own ability.

Q Is the Marionette Townsfolk considered poisoned for the sake of the Acrobat?
A No, they are sober and healthy. Also, they are an evil Minion, and the Acrobat only cares about neighbouring living good players.

Q If the Acrobat is sat next to a Minion what happens?
A The Acrobat's ability skips over evil and dead players,
  looking only at its nearest alive good players.

Q If the Acrobat has a drunk or poisoned neighbour N1 and then is between two sober people N2, do they still die?
  (for instance, they neighbour a drunk Sailor the first night who becomes sober the second)
A The Acrobat dies at their turn in the night order only, so if by then they are between two sober and healthy players, they do not die.

Q Why does the Acrobat, unlike characters with other triggered abilities
  (Choirboy / Farmer / Grandmother / Poppy Grower / Ravenkeeper / Sage / Acrobat / Barber / Hatter / Plague Doctor / Sweetheart / Tinker / Scarlet Woman / ...),
  only act at their spot in the night order?
A Because:
  * it is not intended for the source of drunking / poisoning to be figured out by night order
  * the evil team needs a chance to poison them.

  Some STs do run some of the other triggered abilities at their spot in the night order and they should clarify how they do it.
  But triggered abilities, except the Acrobat, can happen right after whatever triggered them,
  or only slightly delayed until the night time in cases such as:
  * the executed Barber or Hatter
  * the Scarlet Woman, who although would have immediately become the Demon, being formally confirmed as such

=Alchemist=
===========
Q What happens when the Alchemist is drunk or poisoned on their first night? / How does Philosopher picking Alchemist N1 affect the Alchemist?
A Their ability is something the Alchemist starts knowing
  and just as with any start knowing character who is drunk or poisoned
  they can get wrong info on their first night
  that is not corrected if they become sober / healthy.

  On N1 the Alchemist is assigned an out of play Minion ability.
  If they are N1 drunk/poisoned they are told that they have another ability, typically one that is in play,
  and the ST will treat them as having that ability.
  When the Alchemist becomes sober and healthy, they do not change abilities, their actual ability that they had from setup now functions correctly,
  and the ST treats them as having that ability.
  Note that the Alchemist is only ever informed of a change of ability when they actually change ability, which is not the case here, so the ST tells them nothing.

Q Does the Alchemist only change their Minion ability when the current ability enters play?
A Yes.

Q If the Alchemist gains a new ability due to a Hatter, are they informed of the new ability they have,
  or do they have to figure it out like the Cannibal?
A The ST wakes them at night to tell them about their new ability.

Q Can the good Apprentice have the Alchemist so gain a Minion ability?
A Yes.

Q The Bounty Hunter turning the Alchemist evil ... that is just another Minion ability being used by evil, right?
A Yes.

Q The Alchemist Cerenovus picks a player.  What token is that player shown?
A Madness due to the Cerenovus or the Alchemist Cerenovus runs the same:
  the target is still shown the Cerenovus token, as well as the token of the role that they are mad as.

Q Does the Alchemist ping the Chambermaid when they learn what Minion ability they have?
A Yes, and after N1 they might still register to the Chambermaid, depending on the Minion ability gained.

Q How does the Alchemist Evil Twin work?
A The Alchemist ET learns an evil player and their role as their twin.  The evil player learns the Alchemist.
  If the good Alchemist ET is executed, evil wins.

Q What is announced when the Alchemist Fearmonger has picked a player?
A The announcement is the same as for the Fearmonger: "a player has been chosen with the Fearmonger ability”.

Q Can the Alchemist get the Legion ability?
A No, Legion does not register as a Minion until it is in play.

Q Is it valid for the Alchemist Goblin's win condition for them to publicly claim to be the Alchemist Goblin rather than the Goblin?
A Yes.

  Technically the ability requires claiming to be the Goblin in order to win when executed,
  but it would be harsh to not treat both as valid claims.

Q How does the Alchemist who gains the Marionette ability work? / How does the Marionette who thinks that they are the Alchemist work?
A These pairings should be avoided as it is unfun and uninteresting.

  In both cases they are effectively the poisoned/drunk Alchemist and are told the wrong ability that has no effect,
  and the Demon would learn who the Marionette is and would be their neighbour.
  If it is the Alchemist with the Marionette ability,
  the Demon would immediately know this as they would not have been shown them as a Minion during Demon info.

Q How does the Alchemist Mezepheles work?
  Could it turn an evil player good?
A The ability still works as it normally does - the first good player to say the word turns evil.

  The Alchemist can say it immediately and turn themselves evil,
  or they could not say it and not lead anyone else to say it
  and just play for the good team with the knowledge that there is no extra evil player in the game.

Q The Alchemist has the Baron ability, but on the second night, they are drunk / poisoned.
  Can they be told that the Baron has come into play, they now have the Poisoner ability, and for them to choose a player?
  Can they continue to be asked to choose players when they become sober and healthy?
A While drunk or poisoned, they can be told anything. Once they sober up, they must act as their actual ability does.

Q Does the Drunk who thinks that they are the Alchemist Baron add Outsiders?
A No.

Q Does the Alchemist Godfather change the Outsider count?
A Yes, and learns which Outsiders are in play.

Q Does the Alchemist Baron change the Outsider count?
A Yes.  Two Townsfolk characters are replaced by Outsiders.

Q Does the Alchemist with a Minion ability like the Godfather or the Baron change the Outsider count?
A Yes, if they started the game with that ability then its setup effect happens.

  If they start the game with a Minion ability that has no setup effect
  and are later switched to having one that does,
  then the setup effects do not happen mid game.

Q How is the Alchemist run if all the Minion abilities on the script are in play?
A They duplicate an in play ability.

  This could happen for instance in a 14 player Lil' Monsta game, which results in four in play Minions -
  this is why it is better to have 5+ Minions on an Alchemist/Lil’ Monsta scripts to avoid such a scenario.

Q What happens if the Pit-Hag changes a player into the Alchemist but there is no out of play Minion abilities?
A If all Minion abilities are already in play,
  then the ST gives the Alchemist the ability of an in play Minion.
  This is true whether an Alchemist is created after all Minion abilities are put into play or an Alchemist has always been around.

Q Can the Minion the Alchemist has the ability of come into play (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Engineer / ...) ?
A Yes, and the Alchemist would then change ability if there is still an out of play Minion ability available.

  If there is no out of play Minion ability remaining, 
  the Alchemist could either keep the same ability or change to a different in play ability. 
  It should probably change to signal to the Alchemist that the corresponding Minion has entered play as is usually the case.

  If an Alchemist ever changes ability, they should be told by showing the "you are” token, followed by the Alchemist token and new Minion token.

Q Can the Alchemist Pit-Hag make a Pit-Hag?
A Yes, but then as the Alchemist no longer has an out of play minion ability, they must be given a new out of play Minion play.
  Unless all Minion abilities are in play, in which case it is ST choice whether to let the Alchemist keep the Pit-Hag ability or switch it.

Q Does an Alchemist wake up with Minions to decide who babysits Lil' Monsta?
A No, the Alchemist is not a Minion.

Q How does the Alchemist Scarlet Woman work in a Legion game?
A When any Legion player dies, the SW becomes Legion.

Q If the Alchemist has the Vizier ability, do players know that they are the Alchemist?
A They are announced as the Vizier. The "everyone knows who you are" refers to the _ability_ they have.

  The same applies to Cannibal Nightwatchman, Philosopher King etc.

Q How does the Alchemist interact with the Marionette ability?
A From the experimental how to run:
  "Marionette: Do not make the Alchemist the Marionette if you can avoid it, it is not fun or interesting.
  In both cases (the Alchemist who gains the Marionette ability or the Marionette who thinks that they are the Alchemist)
  the only resolution is to just treat them as a poisoned/drunk Alchemist and tell them the wrong ability and not have it affect anyone.
  In both cases the Demon would learn who the Marionette is and would be their neighbour. 
  If it is an Alchemist with the Marionette ability, the Demon would immediately know this as they would not have been shown them as a Minion during Demon info."

Q The Alchemist jinx with the Spy is that the Alchemist cannot get the Spy ability, so if the only out of play Minion is the Spy, does the Alchemist get an in play Minion ability instead?
A That is a reasonable solution.

Q Can the Alchemist Scarlet Woman become the Demon?
A Yes.

Q If the Imp self-kills, does the Alchemist Scarlet Woman become the Imp?
A Yes. But, as the Alchemist is not a Minion, a living Minion also becomes the Imp.

Q If the Alchemist is dead when the Minion she has the ability for is put into play, is she still told she changed ability?
A No, because she no longer has the ability that would be giving her that an out of play Minion ability.
  But if she were to later come back to life, then she would be told she has a new ability,
  but she will not know if that is because that Minion has entered play while she was dead,
  or if the ST just gave her a different out of play Minion ability
  (since that resurrected Alchemist would be a new instance and can get a new ability so long as it is also out of play).

Q Can the Alchemist Goblin be nominated, claim Goblin, then nominate the Virgin, and win?
A Yes.

  The Goblin's ability reads "if you publicly claim to be the Goblin when nominated and are executed that day, your team wins."
  So she does not have to be executed because of her nomination, but if she is executed the same day, her team, the good team, wins.

Q Could the good Goblin be nominated, claim Goblin, then nominate the Virgin, and win?
A No, as the Goblin is a Minion and only Townsfolk can trigger the Virgin.

Q Could the Alchemist Goblin publicly claiming to be the Goblin trigger their win condition if they are executed for breaking Cerenovus madness? 
A Yes, if the ST is feeling really generous.

=============
=Al-Hadikhia=
=============
Q How can the Al-Hadikhia resurrect players?
A A dead player who chooses live will come back to life, as long as one of the other picks says die.

Q For the Al-Hadikhia, do all deaths happen simultaneously (when all choose live) or do they happen in the order chosen?
A In the order chosen, like any multi-kill Demon.
  If a player chooses die they die immediately upon choosing so. If all players live, they each die in the order chosen. 

Q In an Al-Hadikhia game, do other players know who else was chosen? 
A Yes, they are announced publicly.
  The ST will announce, "The Al-Hadikhia has chosen X" then wake X for their choice of live or die.
  Then they do the same for the next two players chosen. All of this is done in player silence.
  So the first player chosen will not know who has been chosen second or third, and the second player chosen will not know who has been chosen third. But all players do learn.
  The ST also asks for silence during this time frame, so the only thing players will be hearing during this time (in terms of the game anyway) is the ST making said announcements.

Q If the Al-Hadikhia is drunk or poisoned, are her picks still woken?
A No, she is drunk / poisoned so she cannot affect other players: there is no announcement and no waking of her targets.
  The Al-Hadikhia will then realise that she was drunk / poisoned or think that she might be the Lunatic.

Q The Al-Hadikhia includes a dead character with a trigger on death ability (Ravenkeeper / Sage / ...) in their three.
  All three picks choose live so all die.
  The dead character was resurrected then died again so should get to use their ability tonight, correct?
A Yes.

  Players are alive the moment that they choose to live. 
  In this case because all players chose to live,
  the Al-Hadikhia attacked all the players again so the resurrected player died and got to use their ability again.

Q If an Al-Hadikhia pick does not die due to protection (Soldier / Innkeeper / Tea Lady / Sailor / Monk / Fool / ...) does this register to the Mathematician?
A Yes, as the Al-Had's ability has malfunctioned due to another character's ability.

  It does not, however, register for the Fool if they end up dying twice to the Al-Hadikhia in the same night as the Fool ability has worked as intended.
  So the Fool dying twice would give a 1 to the Mathematician for the Al-Hadikhia ability but not the Fool ability.

Q If only three players live, one of them being the Al-Hadikhia, and the game moves to the night, does the game end?
A Almost certainly. The game ends as soon as an end condition is met, which can occur before a character ability has fully resolved.
  With just two players left alive the game ends so the game can end in the middle of the Al-Hadikhia's picks,
  which, as with the other multi-kill Demons, happen in order.
  
  If the Al-Hadikhia chooses the three living players with herself last, she is guaranteed to win as long as she says "live":
  If any of the two players before her say die, they die immediately and the game is over with only two players left alive, evil wins.
  If all say "live" then they die in order, so the first player dies leaving just two players left alive, the game is over and evil wins.

  If, instead to be safe, the Al-Hadikhia chooses the other two living players and a dead player,
  then if anyone says die the game is over,
  and if they all choose live, then they all die and, again, the game is over.

  The ST still needs to prompt the Al-Hadikhia for her picks because she could still mess up,
  by choosing dead players that then resurrect:
  a dead pick will say live and at least one of other picks will say die so the game continues because there are now still more than two alive.

  The Al-Hadikhia could get unlucky and end up in a final three with the Soldier and the unprocced Fool ...

Q An Al-Hadikhia and three other players are alive. The Al-Hadikhia picks two other players and themselves in the night, in that order.
  All three pick live, therefore all will die in the order they were picked.
  After the first two players are killed, there are two players alive before the Demon is scheduled to be killed.
  Does evil win right at that moment, or does this instance count as a tie, therefore giving good the win?
A Evil wins in this scenario:
  Evil wins when there are two players alive, and unless an ability says otherwise (such as the Mastermind or the Evil Twin),
  the game immediately ends and abilities do not finish resolving first.

Q Al-Hadikhia picks A B C:
  * A is alive and picks live,
  * B is dead and picks die,
  * C is alive and picks live.
  Do A and C die?
A No. "After waking the third player and taking their choice, if all three players are alive, all three die."
  So A and C do not die.

Q In a final four, if the Barber, the Farmer and the last good/evil player are picked by the Al-Hadikhia and all choose live,
  does the Barber and the Farmer stuff still happen?
A Yes, in the order that they were picked.

  The players would die in the order the Al-Had chose them,
  with any on death abilities handled as they trigger,
  but the ST will end the game as soon as end game condition is met, 
  such as only two players left alive.
  So if the choices were the Farmer, the Barber, and another role in that order,
  the Farmer would die and someone would become the Farmer,
  then the player who was the Barber would die and the game would end. 

  If the Barber were first,
  the Al-Had would be offered the Barber swap,
  and if they swapped themselves then the rest of the kills would not happen.
  If they instead swapped the Barber with the Farmer,
  then the Farmer would not trigger and instead there would be another Barber swap.
  Theoretically there could be three Barber swaps.

Q How does the Barista doubled Al-Hadikhia work?
A The entirety of the choosing and killing process happens twice:
  from the Al-Hadikhia choosing three players who decide to live/die to the end of the activation,
  then back to the start to do it again.

Q Does the Barista doubled target of the Al-Hadikhia get to choose to live or die twice?
A No, it is only that player's ability that is doubled, not the Al-Hadikhia’s.

Q Why is the Courtier a bad idea in an Al-Hadikhia script?
A On D2 everyone will know the Al-Hadikhia is in play.
  At that point the Courtier will drunk the Al-Had,
  which is completely unbluffable by the evil team.
  Thus the Courtier will always be confirmed and get to wipe out the Al-Hadikhia for three nights.

Q What happens when the Exorcist picks the Al-Hadikhia?
A The Al-Hadikhia does not get to pick and there are no announcements.
  This would look no different to the Al-Hadikhia being drunked or poisoned, so the town would be unsure of the cause.

Q If the only Al-Hadikhia pick who chooses death is the unspent Fool, who dies?
A The Fool initially survives due to her ability, then as all three are alive, all die in the order that they were picked.
  As this would now be the Fool's second death, she is killed outright. This all assumes no other sources of protection.

  Arguably the unspent Fool should always say no to dying...

Q Does the Gambler know if they died to their own ability if they are resurrected the same night by the Al-Hadikhia?
A The Gambler never knows whether they have died to their own ability.
  So, they could gamble incorrectly and die,
  then be chosen by the Al-Hadikhia and choose live
  and therefore be resurrected and would not know whether they gambled correctly or not as the net effect is the same.

Q If one of the Al-Hadikhia's targets is the unpicked Goon, what happens?
A The Al-Hadikhia is drunked immediately, so there are no announcements or waking of any of the targets who all live.

Q If the evil Goon is resurrected by the Al-Hadikhia, are they still evil?
A Yes.  Resurrection does not change alignment.

Q What happens if the grandchild and the Grandmother are both in the same Al-Hadikhia selection?
A If the grandchild dies to the Al-Hadikhia,
  the Grandmother dies too,
  but they can then be resurrected in the same night and therefore not know if their ability worked or not.

  If the grandchild is the first Al-Hadikhia pick and chooses to die, also killing the Grandmother,
  and the Grandmother is the second pick and chooses to live so coming back to life,
  they should probably be given the same grandchild,
  as a new grandchild would give them too much confirmation.

Q The Al-Hadikhia picks the Innkeeper and the two Innkeeper targets.
  If all choose live, do all die, or just the Innkeeper?
  If all three die at the same time, does the Innkeeper protection kick in?
A The Al-Had visits three players in an order over the night phase, offering them the choice to live or die.
  Any player picking die, dies instantly.
  Once all three are visited, a check is performed: are all three players alive?
  If they are all alive then,
  according to the current ruling,
  they are killed in the order that the Al-Had picked,
  and not simultaneously as some argue should be the case.

  So in this example if the Innkeeper was picked first, all three would die.
  If the Innkeeper was not the first choice, then the protected player(s) chosen beforehand would stay alive.

Q Could the Al-Hadikhia be drunked if they are picked by the Innkeeper or the Sailor?
A Yes, but don't.

  Without other reasons for the Al-Hadikhia to be blocked
  it is likely that town will narrow the Demon candidates down to the Innkeeper / Sailor pick(s) ...

Q If the Klutz / Moonchild chooses death when woken for the Al-Hadikhia, when do they make their pick?
A At the start of the next day.

  Although the player might choose death on being woken for their Al-Hadikhia choice,
  she does not actually know if she died until it is announced in the morning as she could be protected by another character,
  so her pick happens publicly in the morning.

Q If the dead Klutz / Moonchild is picked by the Al-Hadikhia and chooses live but then dies because all picks were alive, 
  does their ability trigger?
A No.

  Both the Moonchild and Klutz pick when they learn that they have died,
  but as nothing is ever announced by the ST when a player is resurrected and killed in the same night, 
  they are never prompted to use their ability,
  even if they surmise that they must have been alive at some point.

Q Does the Demon learn who the Lunatic Al-Hadikhia chose?
A Yes.  If the actual Demon is not the Al-Hadikhia then the Lunatic will know straight away who they really are.

Q What is the Al-Hadikhia jinx with the Mastermind?
A This is a hate jinx: only one of these characters can be in play.
  Additionally, evil players start knowing which player and character it is.

  They are hate jinxed because a Mastermind day is pointless when the Demon announces its presence every night;
  everyone will know when they get the Demon and the Mastermind cannot really accomplish anything.
  It would go something like:
  # the Al-Had is executed,
  # there are no announcements the following night
  # everyone realises the Demon must be dead,
  # everyone realises that it must be the player that was just executed,
  # everyone realises it must be a Mastermind day,
  # the MM feels completely useless.

Q How does the Al-Hadikhia targeting the Mayor work?
A The Mayor can bounce an Al-Hadikhia kill from themselves to another player if they choose to die.
  If all three picks are then still alive so all three must die, the Mayor can again bounce the kill.

  As an extreme example:
  # the Mayor and players A and B are chosen by the Al-Hadikhia and announced to town,
  # only the Mayor says die and their kill bounces to C, who dies,
  # all three picks are alive so all should die, and the Mayor bounces again to D,
  # so players A, B, C and D die in the night despite only the Mayor, A and B being announced as Al-Hadikhia targets.

  If the ST were do this though it would all but hard-confirm the Mayor and the Al-Hadikhia cannot easily stop them surviving to final three, but it is a fun interaction!

Q Does the Monk stop a player from being chosen by the Al-Hadikhia?
A No, they are still picked and must make a choice.

Q How does the Pit-Hag interact with the Al-Hadikhia?
A If the Pit-Hag creates a new Demon, and one of the two is the Al-Hadikhia who is not immediately killed before they awake,
  then the Al-Hadikhia can be woken and their choices taken, announced and processed,
  but the ST can choose to kill or protect anyone throughout the process using the Pit-Hag ability.
  
  It is generally a good idea to kill the Al-Hadikhia if they or a second Demon in an Al-Hadikhia game are created by the Pit-Hag
  as otherwise they can resurrect the other Demon relatively easily and have two living evil Demons.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns the Demon into the Al-Hadikhia, deaths are arbitrary, but should the ST wake the Al-Hadikhia and her targets?
A Deaths are arbitrary until the end of the night giving the ST a lot of freedom since Demons wake later than the Pit-Hag,
  but if the Al-Hadikhia is alive, sober and healthy
  then the waking up and announcing stuff is not optional: it must happen.

  This potentially already informs good players that the Demon has changed,
  so the ST might choose not to interfere with anything and ignore the option for arbitrary deaths.

Q If the Poppy Grower dies in an Al-Hadikhia game, when should the evil team learn each other?
A If the PG is killed by the Al-Hadikhia, the evil team learn each other immediately.
  Generally, if this is not going to affect the other Al-Hadikhia choices,
  then it is safe to wait until after the other choices to tell the evil players,
  but if a Minion or, worryingly, two, have been picked by the Al-Hadikhia along with the Poppy Grower,
  then the ST should tell them before waking them for their Al-Hadikhia choice as it will affect their decision.

Q If the Al-Hadikhia dies and the Scarlet Woman becomes a new Al-Hadikhia, could the new Al-Had resurrect the old Al-Had with their ability?
A Yes, then the ex-SW would become the SW again (hence the Al-Had and SW jinx to prevent two alive demons).

Q What happens when the Al-Hadikhia targets the player favoured by the Storm Catcher?
A The Storm Caught player can be picked by the Al-Hadikhia but cannot die.
  This can be a way to force a good player who does not want to die to do so,
  because it reduces the field to the Storm Caught player and two characters who do not want to die,
  one of whom is going to have to choose to do so or both of them will instead.

Q When does the Sweetheart drunk a player if they are killed by the Al-Hadikhia?
A The Sweetheart drunks someone as soon as they die.
  So they could drunk a character that dies later within the Al-Hadikhia choices or even the Al-Hadikhia herself, 
  immediately ending har activation at that moment but
  this is a probably a bad idea as it confirms the Sweetheart as good as well as wiping out the Demon ability.

Q What happens when the Tinker is one of the Al-Hadikhia’s picks?
A The Tinker can choose to live for their Al-Hadikhia choice,
  then die before the other players have chosen to live or die,
  ensuring that one of the three is dead and preventing an "all three die" situation.

  The ST probably would not do this because:
  * either the Tinker will generally be happy to say die
  * or it would be harsh on the Al-Hadikhia who was about to get a rare triple kill.

Q What happens if the Widow is resurrected by the Al-Hadikhia?
A They immediately wake to see the grimoire and choose a player to be poisoned. 
  This does not have to happen in between the Al-Hadikhia kills,
  but should if their choice of poison could affect what happens when the other players selected by the Al-Hadikhia that night make their choices.
  A good player should also be told that the Widow is in play.

==========
=Amnesiac=
==========
Q What should the ST respond if the Amnesiac says "I would like to claim Amnesiac and start a cult" when their ability has nothing to do with that?
  Just say no? Let the cult run? Something else?
A ST choice.

Q Does the Amnesiac's ability act as soon as it can, or after they discover their ability?
A Their ability is always working.
  Technically they could have an ability that does not do anything unless or until the Amne guesses their ability fully but that is unlikely to be fun.


============
=Apprentice=
============
Q How does the Apprentice work?
A She will get the ability of a Townsfolk (if good) or a Minion (if evil).

  Everyone will know that the player is a Traveller and that they are the Apprentice, but will not know her alignment or what ability she has,
  otherwise an evil Apprentice would just get instantly exiled.

==========
=Assassin=
==========
Q Can the Assassin kill the storm caught Townsfolk?
A No.
  The Storm Catcher's ability and the Assassin ability are at odds with one another
  and while fabled characters do not inherently trump other characters,
  it is the intention that the Storm Catcher does trump the Assassin.

Q If the Assassin picks the alive Zombuul, does the game end?
A Yes.

Q Does the Assassin trump the Mayor?
A Yes, the Mayor just dies.  There can be no bounce, either to die instead of the Mayor or in addition to the Mayor.

Q Does the Fool die if targeted by the Assassin?
A Yes. The Fool ability counts as something that would prevent them from dying, so the Assassin ignores it and actually kills them. 

Q Can the Assassin kill the Lleech?
A Yes.

Q Does the Lycanthrope stop an Assassin kill?
A No.  The Assassin can still kill if the Lycanthrope hits a good player.

=========
=Atheist=
=========
Q In an Atheist game the ST can break the rules but in the instance of the Lunatic Kazali,
  can their picks be told that they are now Minions, while keeping their alignment as good?
A Yes.

  The only real restriction in an Atheist games is no evil players at setup.
  Arguably it is against the spirit of the Atheist to introduce Minions and Demons after setup,
  regardless of if they are good or not.
  But ultimately what is acceptable in an Atheist game is up to the ST and their group.

Q Can the Devil's Advocate protect the ST if there is an Atheist in the game?
A ST choice.

  RAW the ST is not a player so is never a valid target for abilities, 
  but in an Atheist game the ST is free to break any rule so can allow it.
  However, as the Atheist only requires the ST's execution not their death, preventing them from dying would not accomplish anything.

Q Does the Atheist prevent new evil characters from being created after the game has begun?
A No, in an Atheist game the ST can break all rules and turn people evil.
  However, this is usually not fun for the players and not advised; keep all players good and give fake information that they need to "solve" as intended.

Q Can puzzledrunking the Atheist mean evil roles can be included in the game?
A No. 

  The Atheist has a setup ability, the Puzzlemaster does not,
  so no one is puzzledrunk until after the tokens go out.

  The ST can make the Atheist _the_ Drunk or the Marionette,
  otherwise when the Atheist is in the bag there must be no evil characters.

Q If the Philosopher chooses the Atheist in a game that started with the Mastermind, and the ST then dies, could the ST "break the rules" making themself be considered the Demon?
A If the ST allowed the Philo-Atheist ability to remain in play, the ST can do whatever they want.

Q In an Atheist game the Alchemist has the Pit-Hag ability.
  If the Alchemist makes good a Demon that the town then executes, does the good team win or must the ST be executed?
A With the Atheist the ST can decide if the good team wins.

Q Who wins if the Atheist was drunk when the ST was executed?
A If the Atheist was drunk and there is no Demon in play then good would already have won.
  If there is a demon in play then evil would win.

  Although, if there is no evil team usually the ST will break the rules to keep the Atheist sober and not end the game by them being drunk.

Q Can there be an Atheist game without anyone being shown the Atheist token?
A Atheist "can" questions are almost certainly answerable with a "yes." Whether the ST should or not is debatable.
  So technically the ST can break the rules to do that, but probably should not.

Q Does the Engineer in an Atheist game create new evils or just not work?
A The Engineer can only change the characters of existing Demons and Minions (without breaking the rules). 
  In an Atheist game, the ST is reasonably likely to pretend that it has been effective, though, by changing what Demon/Minion abilities the town is hallucinating.

Q Does a nominated ST get a defence? 
  In a non Atheist game (with it on the script of course) could the ST use game state information in their defence?
  (e.g. they think claiming the nominating player is evil helps balance)
A If they want one, sure.
  They could say something funny like "ok” or "nooooo pleeeeaaaase I’m innoceeeeent”
  They would have to do that every time they were nominated to not give anything away though, probably too hard to balance and gives away too much info.
  "Go ahead, lose the game" is also an option.

Q Can the Philosopher choose Atheist?
A Yes. 
  Evil players are not removed from the game as that part of Atheist's ability is a setup ability, so it has no effect if entering play mid game.
  Good can now win the game be executing the ST.
  However, the ST can now do whatever they want, which typically will also include them uncreating the Atheist.

Q If Atheist is not on the script, can the Storyteller be executed?
A No. Executing the ST is only allowed when the Atheist is on the script, otherwise even nominating the ST is not allowed.




============
=Balloonist=
============
Q Is it legal to have a Balloonist in a Legion game with no Outsiders?
A Yes, but since the Balloonist will only receive three pings, they will likely learn that they are in a Legion game.

Q Is it legal to have the Balloonist in play when the Kazali turns all the Outsiders into Minions?
A Yes, the Kazali's [setup ability] means the setup is legal whatever the Outsider count.

Q What happens when the Philosopher chooses Balloonist in a zero Outsider game?
A They gain the ability. They do not add an Outsider though, and will end up only learning three names, unless an Outsider is introduced (Pit-Hag) before N4.
  Should an Outsider be created after N4, it would be too late; once they have learned one of every in play character type, they lose their ability. 

Q Can the Balloonist get pings on dead players?
A Yes.

Q Could a Minion holding Lil' Monsta be shown twice to the Balloonist - once as a Minion and once as a Demon?
A Yes.

Q After a Minion is chosen by the Preacher, can they still be seen as such by the Balloonist?
A Yes, a preached Minion is still a Minion.

Q Could the Balloonist be shown the Recluse multiple times?
A Yes. The Recluse can register three times to the Balloonist, as an Outsider, a Minion and the Demon.

Q If the Balloonist sees the Snake Charmer as a Townsfolk, could they see the same player again after they successfully charm the Demon?
A Yes.

Q Could the Balloonist be shown the Spy multiple times?
A Yes. The Spy can register three times to the Balloonist, as a Townsfolk, an Outsider and a Minion.

  If the Spy ever holds Lil' Monsta then they could register as the Demon as well and be shown up to four times!
  But then as this would confirm them to be the Spy, potentially holding Lil' Monsta, this might not be a fun thing to do.

Q Can a single Legion player be shown to the Balloonist twice, once as a Minion and once as a Demon?
A Yes.

Q Can the Balloonist learn the name of a Traveller?
A No, unless they are holding Lil' Monsta or they are an Apprentice Spy.

--------------reword
Q How does drunking and poisoning work with the Balloonist?
  e.g. the Balloonist is poisoned N1, the ST points at a Minion and, in the grimoire, puts the Townsfolk reminder next to the Minion.
  If the Balloonist is no longer droisoned the next night, is the Townsfolk reminder still valid or does the Minion now count as a Minion? 
  i.e. does the ST choose something to "consume" at the time they point to a player or do they reevaluate each night?
A Once the Townsfolk reminder token is placed it is used, so the ST could show the same Minion again as a Minion if they wanted,
  but they could not show the sober Balloonist a Townsfolk anymore.

Q The Balloonist saw the Minion that the Imp starpassed to. Do they later see the same Minion again as the Demon?
A They can, or they can be shown the dead Imp.

Q In a base zero Outsider game, with both the Balloonist and the Vigormortis in play, is one a legal amount of Outsiders? 
  Or should it be net zero Outsiders?
  Is this ruling ST dependent?
A ST choice. One Outsider is legal.
  Most players prefer the net total method as the most intuitive choice.

Q What happens if the Balloonist dies and is resurrected (Professor / Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / ...) ?
A They are a fresh incarnation of the Balloonist
  so their reminder tokens are cleared and they would restart their info from scratch.



========
=Barber=
========
Q Does the Barber interrupt multi-kill Demons (Al-Hadikhia / Po / Shabaloth)?
A Yes.  If the Barber is killed by the Demon, the Demon is woken and offered the swap.
  If the Demon swaps herself then the rest of her picks are skipped: no one dies / wakes to choose life or death.

Q Is the Soldier safe when the Demon uses the Barber swap on them?
A No.

Q Could the Barber be swapped with a living player after they die and then the new Barber could get killed to trigger the swap again, repeatedly?
A Yes.

Q The Barber dies in a Legion game. The ST wakes one Legion and they swap themselves with another Legion. 
  Since neither player changed roles, does the ST tell the other Legion?
A The Demon cannot use the Barber to swap with a second Demon.

Q Can the former Scarlet Woman who is now the Demon, use the Barber to swap the previous Demon with a living player?
A No, the Barber's ability explicitly disallows choosing another Demon.

Q Why is "not another demon" clarified on the Barber's ability?
A If there is a dead Fang Gu, and that clause did not exist, a living Fang Gu could swap the dead Fang Gu with a Minion and get two living evil Fang Gus.
  This could also happen with the Pit-Hag creating multiple demons.

Q Can the current Demon kill the Barber and swap a dead Demon with a Minion, leading to two alive demons?  Can the ST kill on of them and have kills be arbitrary?
A Demons cannot choose other Demons with the Barber ability (it says so under the Barber's ability).
  The ST also cannot arbitrarily kill anyone with the Barber ability, only with the Pit-Hag ability when a new Demon is created.

Q Can a dead Demon (game continues due to the Evil Twin) revive the Demon with a Barber swap?
A Yes. But only themselves, since it says "not another Demon"
  The extra Barber rule is to prevent two alive Demons.

Q If the Barber dies and no Demons are alive, who decides the swap? 
  Can a dead Demon move the demonhood back to a living player? 
A If no Demons are alive, then a dead Demon gets the swap. 
  They cannot swap another dead Demon into a living player,
  but they can swap their own demon ability back into play.

Q If the Barber dies in a game with no living Demons (Evil Twin in play, evil Demon executed) would the dead Demon still get to make the swap?
A Yes, "the Demon" may be a dead Demon if there are no alive Demons.

Q If a Farmer is Barber swapped with a Farmer does the ST have to tell the Farmers? 
A No, the rules say players always learn if their character changes and their character did not change.

Q Is the Barber able to swap a Traveller and a Townsfolk?
A The ST can allow it but generally no.

Q The Barber is killed. Can alignment be changed, say by the Demon swapping herself?
A Barber swaps do not change alignment, only character.

Q Can the Barber change the good twin, if the Demon swaps one of the twins? 
A If the Demon chooses to Barber swap the good twin player, then they are still the good twin, and the Evil Twin gets updated about what character they are now.
  If the Demon chooses to Barber swap the Evil Twin, then there will be a new ET pair who will get woken that night to learn each other.

Q If the dead Damsel gets swapped in to a living player from the Barber,
  is it random like it is for the Pit-Hag?
A No.

Q Does Barber swapping two players make new instances of these characters, refreshing their abilities?
A Yes.

=========
=Barista=
=========
Q How does the Barista doubled Fool work?
A If they still have their ability, then they can die three times today, otherwise they can die twice.

Q How does the Barista doubled Marionette work?
A The Marionette would be deceived that they have two uses of the ability that they think they have.
  If they are Barista doubled N1 then technically the Demon should be told twice about them.

Q The Witch is Barista doubled, and curses two players.  If the Barista is exiled or travels away, are both of those players still cursed?
A Yes, the doubling is a one time effect that cannot be retroactively undone.

Q If the Barista makes the Amnesiac act twice, do they get to guess their ability twice?
A That would make sense, plus their Amne-ability functions twice.

Q How does the Barista doubled Lleech work?
A If the Lleech is chosen on N1 then they choose two players, both of whom are poisoned from now on, and both must die in order for the Lleech to die.
  If the Lleech is chosen after N1 then they kill twice.

Q What effect does the Barista have on the King?
A The Barista only has an effect when the dead outnumber the living. Once this is the case, Barista 1 gives the King true info and Barista doubling gives the King two character tokens to see.

Q How does the Barista doubled Huntsman work?
A If they have yet to guess then they can choose two players in one night, otherwise they can be woken to make another guess.

Q How does the Barista doubled Philosopher work?
A If the Philo has yet to pick an ability, they gain two abilities, and potentially drunk two characters.
  If they have, they can gain an additional ability on top of their current one.
  
  The ability/abilities gained are not doubled.

Q How does the Barista doubled Boomdandy work?
A If the Boomdandy is Barista-doubled on a day they are not executed, nothing happens.

  On a day they are executed, they try to kill N (number of total players) minus 3,
  then try to kill N minus 3 players again (these do not need to be the same players),
  then when the pointing minute is complete, the player with the most pointing at them dies twice (if applicable).
  Note this means that the Barista doubled Boomdandy can kill the unused Fool before the pointing starts
  or the living Zombuul/unused Fool can be killed twice to end the game with the pointing.

Q Does Barista 1 have an effect on the Demon?
A Only if they would have otherwise been poisoned or drunk.

Q How does the Barista doubled Barber work?
A The Demon is woken to make a swap, goes to sleep, then immediately wakes again to make a second swap.
  If the Demon changes inbetween swaps, then it is the new Demon making the second swap.

Q What effect does Barista doubling the Fearmonger have?
A The Fearmonger can pick two players that night and nominating and executing either of them the following day will end the game.

  This could potentially result in two announcements of the Fearmonger selecting new players,
  so the Fearmonger will want to be careful in this situation not to reveal the Barista is evil and the Fearmonger has two selections that night.

Q Do roles that receive info only on N1 benefit from being selected by the Barista on later nights?
A Not a Barista 1 (sober + healthy + true), but a Barista 2 (ability works twice) could give them info again
  as their first night ability will work on a night other than the first.

Q What does a Barista 1 Drunk / Marionette do?
A ST choice:
  * as well as being sober and healthy, they would have to get true information if they think they are an info role,
  * they still should get arbirtary info.

  The ST should clarify how they run this interaction when the Barista is in town and the Drunk or the Marionette are on the script.

Q With Barista, can the ST choose that a character is sober and healthy, if they were already sober and healthy?
A Yes. That player would then be informed of the Barista choice so they would know for a fact they are sober and healthy, which is still pretty helpful,
  but not for start knowing roles where being sober and healthly now does not help them at all.

Q What does a Barista 1 Fortune Teller learn if she chooses her Red Herring?
A She would ignore their Red Herring.  Also she would not see the Recluse as the Demon.

Q If the Cannibal eats an evil player and then somehow becomes healthy (Barista / Amnesiac / ...),
  do they gain any ability?
A They gain the ability.
  A Barista'd Cannibal who eats the Spy is interesting.
  A Barista'd Cannibal who eats the Widow is completely hilarious.
  The ST should probably avoid giving a Barista bonus to the Cannibal.

Q How does the Barista work twice on the Savant?
A The Savant prompts the ST twice, and receives two sets of statements; one true and one false each.
  They do not receive two true statements and then two false.

Q Can the Barista let the Demon kill twice? 
A Yes.

Q What does a Barista 1 Savant learn?
A Two true statements.

Q When a once-per-use character is Barista 2'd,
  can they choose to use their ability once to use the extra use and keep their original use?
  e.g. Slayer, Artist, Damsel (!?), ...
A No.

Q What does a Barista doubled Damsel do?
A If the Damsel guess has already been used,
  then the Minions may attempt one more guess today.
  If the guess has not already been used,
  then they may attempt two guesses today.

  However, as it is the Damsel that is told about the Barista doubling,
  the Minions will be unaware of the extra guess unless the Damsel announced it.

Q Does the Barista doubled Pit-Hag who uses their first pick to turn themselves into something else still get a second use of the Pit-Hag ability?
A No, as they no longer have the Pit-Hag ability.

Q Does the Barista doubled Pit-Hag who with her last pick turns herself into a role that acts after the Pit-Hag, get to use their new role twice too?
A Yes.

Q Does the Barista doubled Snake Charmer who hits the Demon get to make two kills as the Demon?
A Yes.

Q Does the Barista doubled Philosopher get to pick two abilities that night?
A Yes, but the Barista doubled Philosopher is completely broken so best not to do it.

========
=Beggar=
========
Q Does a living Beggar without a vote still count for purposes of majority voting? 
A Yes.

Q Can the Beggar learn the Recluse as evil?
A Yes.


========
=Bishop=
========
Q How does the interaction between Judge and Bishop work?
  If the ST does not nominate a Bishop-opposed player first and the Judge ends it, then the day ends without the ST nominating an opposed player.
A The Judge's ability wins out in that case. The day just ends without the ST nominating an opposing player.
  The players can account for the fact that the Judge may have interrupted a day's worth of alignment information.

Q Can the ST call for the exile of a Traveller when the Bishop is in play?
A No.

================
=Bone Collector=
================
Q If the Bone Collector picks the Marionette or the Drunk, what happens?
A They get another day/night of the ability that they think they have.

Q Does the ST inform a player that the they have been chosen by the Bone Collector?
A No.  But they can probably infer this when their ability works again.

Q Does the Bone Collector give the Slayer another use of their ability?
A Yes.

Q Can the Bone collector ability only be used once or every night?
A It is a once per game ability.

Q The Artist is dead. The Bone Collector targets the Artist at night. The Pukka poisons the Bone Collector later that same night. 
  The Artist tries to use their power the next day. Does it work?
A No; the BC is the only reason the Artist would be able to use their ability while dead and they are poisoned, so their ability is not functioning.

===========
=Boomdandy=
===========

Q What happens when the Klutz dies to the Boomdandy?
A At whatever point the Klutz is declared dead, the Klutz should interject to choose an alive (at that point) player.

Q What happens when the Moonchild dies to the Boomdandy?
A Like the Klutz, when the Moonchild is declared dead, they should interject to choose an alive (at that point) player.
  Unlike the Klutz though it is less critical for the game as to what they do.

Q Can the Apprentice have the Boomdandy ability?
A The Apprentice should not be given the Boomdandy ability, as it does not do anything on exile.

Q Can the Butcher still nominate after the Boomdandy is executed?
A Yes.  This is usually the only way the good team can save themselves from an accidental tie in the Boomdandy pointing.
  However, this requires there to have been some other reason for more than three players to be alive after the Boomdandy kills
  as ordinarily if there was a Butcher and two others left alive, the game would end with an evil win.

Q Can the Deviant die when the Boomdandy explodes?
A Yes as it is not an exile.

Q Can the Gangster still kill in the minute after the Boomdandy explodes?
A Yes.
  However, this requires there to have been some other reason for more than three players to be alive after the Boomdandy kills
  as ordinarily if there was a Gangster and two others left alive, the game would end with an evil win.

Q Is the Doomsayer still active in the minute after the Boomdandy explodes?
A The only time a player can Doomsay during the Boomdandy minute is if there are more than three players left alive for whatever reason
  as in all other cases there will only be three players living and therefore the Doomsayer has no ability.

Q Can the sober Sailor still die in the Boomdandy's explosion?
A No, they would have to remain alive in the final three.

Q If the Slayer survives the Boomdandy's explosion, can she still take her shot?
A Yes, she may act during the minute after the Boomdandy's kills are announced.
  As this is extraordinarily powerful in this context, the unused Slayer should probably die to the Boomdandy.

Q Could the Acrobat that survives when the Boomdandy explode die if any of their surviving neighbours is drunk or poisoned?
A No, the Acrobat ability is only checked at night, so they would not die until that night.

Q Can the Demon die when the Boomdandy explodes and have their Scarlet Woman become the new Demon?
A Yes, if the Boomdandy deaths happen in the right order,
  the SW can become the Demon,
  as long as the Demon dies with more than four alive.

Q After the Boomdandy explodes resulting in only three players left alive,
  can a player who is mad (Mutant / Cerenovus target / Harpy target / ...) still be executed for breaking madness?
A Yes.
  This will almost certainly end the game as it will likely leave only two living players (the Boomdandy’s resulting three minus the mad player).

Q What happens when the Sweetheart dies when the Boomdandy explodes?
A The Sweetheart makes someone drunk when they die.
  Usually this should be a player that is also dying to the Boomdandy ability.
  They could drunk the Boomdandy to immediately stop the killing and move the game straight to night without any pointing,
  but this is a terrible idea as it is using an Outsider to help the good team immensely, and confirming both a good and evil player in the process.

Q If the Tinker survives the Boomdandy, could they immediately die afterwards, ending the game with an evil win?
A Yes, but don't.

Q Does the Boomdandy still trigger if they are executed but do not die (Devil's Advocate protection)?
A Yes. As this hard-confirms them as the Boomdandy, it is a good idea for the Boomdandy to die in their explosion.

Q After the Boomdandy triggers, can the Cult Leader call for a cult?
A Yes, but don't allow it.

  RAW the Cult Leader can call for a cult in the one minute time if they are still alive and did not call for a cult earlier in the day,
  but this should be disallowed as it is either going to go over the time limit or take up a disproportionate amount of the time limit which is intended for discussion.

Q Can the unspent Fool die to the Boomdandy?
A The Fool cannot be killed twice by the Boomdandy's boom,
  so if their ability is unused they will survive,
  but if they are "killed" once by the boom and then killed again by the pointing, they would die.

Q Can the Gossip still gossip if they have not already done so that day, after the Boomdandy triggers?
A Yes, but this is probably pointless and not advised.

Q Can the Mayor win the game after the Boomdandy is triggered and no one dies after the pointing?
A No. Even though there are three players left alive at the end of the day, the Boomdandy's execution earlier that day means that the Mayor ability cannot trigger.

Q If the Boomdandy is executed, would the in play Minstrel immediately drunk them, preventing their exploding?
A Yes.

Q Does the protection / poisoning / drunking immediately end when the Boomdandy's explosion kills any sources of such
  (Innkeeper / Tea Lady / Philosopher / ...)?
A Yes.  The targets of such abilities immediately lose their protection / become healthy / sober.

Q Can the Pixie still gain their ability for the one minute after the Boomdandy explodes, killing their marked player?
A Yes.

Q After the Boomdandy is triggered can the Artist still ask the ST their question, in the post-execution minute?
A Yes, but this does not extend the time limit.

Q After the Boomdandy is triggered can the Fisherman  still get their advice within the post-execution minute?
A Yes, but this does not extend the time limit.

Q After the Boomdandy is triggered can the Savant still get their info within the post-execution minute?
A Yes, but this does not extend the time limit.

Q What if there is a tie in a Boomdandy vote?
A Noone dies, the game goes to night, and the Demon presumably kills.

Q If the Boomdandy explodes in a Lleech game, 
  the host must remain but does the Lleech need to remain alive as well?
A The Lleech host must be alive and the Lleech too since they can only die with their host.

Q Can the Pacifist block deaths caused by the Boomdandy being executed?
A No. The Pacifist saves good players specifically from execution, and Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q If the Saint is killed when the Boomdandy explodes, is that an evil win?
A No. The Saint needs to die to execution for evil to win, and Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q Is a player protected by the Devil's Advocate safe from dying when the Boomdandy explodes?
A No. The DA protects players from execution, and Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q If the Goblin player publically claims Goblin and dies when the Boomdandy explodes, is that an evil win?
A No. The Goblin needs to be executed, and Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q If the Boomdandy explodes in a Leviathan game, do the deaths count towards the Leviathan's execution count?
A No, as Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q If the Boomdandy explodes, is it okay to kill the Demon and have the game continue into a Mastermind day?
A No that would be an evil loss.  In order to trigger a Mastermind day the Demon must be executed, and Boomdandy deaths are not due to execution.

Q Can the Demon die when the Boomdandy goes off and the Scarlet Woman is in play?
A Yes, that is legal, as long as there are five players alive when the Demon dies. The SW will reason that they are now the Demon.

Q If the Boomdandy is executed on final three, does the Boomdandy's ability still trigger and all players point to either of the last two players alive?
A No. Two players alive is the evil team's win condition, so the game ends and evil wins.

Q Who should the ST kill when the Boomdandy triggers?
A It is going to be very specific to the exact characters in play and alive.
  Some general guidelines and ideas:
  * In most cases, leave the Demon alive in the final three, otherwise the game ends in good’s favour using a Minion ability.
  * The Demon can be killed if there is an Evil Twin pair both still alive, leaving the choice for town to choose between the two twins with a non-Demon third player.
  * The final three cannot be the twins and the Demon as that is an automatic evil win.
  * It is a bad idea to leave hard-confirmed characters alive in final three.
    A final three that includes the proc'd Virgin and the Professor who resurrected a dead player would be unfair on evil who managed to get their Boomdandy executed.
  * If the Klutz killed by the Boomdandy chose a player between executions, the Klutz-picked player can be left alive to cast suspicion on the Klutz claim.
  * There is no mechanical problem to leave only evil left alive in final three as the Boomdandy kill does not require a nomination,
    just the pointing, but this can be very hard on good to have to work out exactly which of the evil players is actually the Demon.
  * There are some abilities that can prevent the Boomdandy coming down to a final three and instead having four or even five left alive. 
    While this can be interesting, it should be used sparingly, as it soft-confirms a few players
    (the player claiming Sailor or Fool is almost certainly good / the Tea Lady and their neighbours / ... ). 


===============
=Bounty Hunter=
===============
Q Does the Drunk or the Marionette that sees the Bounty Hunter token turn a Townsfolk evil?
A No.  The ST must decide to make the Bounty Hunter the Drunk or the Marionette
  before a Townsfolk is woken and told that they are evil as a result of the Bounty Hunter ability.

Q If the Bounty Hunter sees the Fool do they need to die twice for the BH to learn another player?
A Yes.

Q Is a Townsfolk still turned evil on N1 if the Bounty Hunter is drunked (Courtier / Sailor / ...) or poisoned (Lleech / ...)?
A No, as this is a setup ability so will have happened before the tokens are sent out.

Q If the Lleech chooses the Bounty Hunter turned Townsfolk, are they still turned evil?
A Yes, this is a [setup] ability and has already occurred.

Q Does the Cannibal gaining the Bounty Hunter ability see the same evil player the BH saw?
A They do not have to.

Q How does a Barista 2 Bounty Hunter work?
A They could learn two evil players in one night.
  They would learn another player when either of those two players died.
  This means the Bounty Hunter has two instances of their ability from that point on - when either ‘client’ dies, they learn a new name. 
  It is usually a good idea to show them the same player after both "client A" and "client B" die, 
  to restore the Bounty Hunter to knowing only a single player at a time from then on.


Q Can the Bounty Hunter learn the currently evil Cult Leader?
A The Bounty Hunter can learn any evil player, so yes,
  and the BH will only learn a new player when the Cult Leader dies regardless of any subsequent alignment change.
  
  The BH would not be able to learn the CL on N1 as they can only change alignment at the end of the night, after the BH wakes,
  unless the BH themselves turned the CL at setup.

Q Can the Spy register as a good Townsfolk in order to be turned evil by the Bounty Hunter?
A Yes, but this is not recommended.

Q Does the Bounty Hunter who learns the Zombuul still learn a different player after the Zombuul 'dies' for the first time?
A Yes.

Q If the Bounty Hunter’s evil Townsfolk is turned into an Outsider, are they still evil or do they become good and a new Townsfolk turned evil?
A They remain evil, as they were turned on setup and their alignment being evil is not an ongoing effect and not linked to their character.

Q Does the Bounty Hunter sitting next to the No Dashii still turn a Townsfolk evil? 
A Yes, because it is a setup effect.

Q Can the Bounty Hunter learn the Recluse?
A Yes.

Q Are the Minions and the Demon informed of the Townsfolk turned evil by the Bounty Hunter?
A No.

Q Can the Bounty Hunter be the evil Townsfolk?
A Yes, but this is not recommended.

Q Can the Bounty Hunter learn a Vigor-killed Minion?
A Yes, it is possible for them to learn any dead evil player.
  The only restriction is that they cannot learn the same player twice in a row.
  The ST will need to consider if this is a fair move,
  since the BH only gets a new name when their current target dies, and the dead cannot die (unless they are first resurrected somehow),
  so showing them a dead evil player probably means that they will get no more info for the rest of the game.

Q If the Bounty Hunter dies and then is resurrected (Professor / Al-Hadikhia / ...) do they learn a new evil player?
A Yes, which can be the same previously learnt player or a new evil player.

Q If an evil player the Bounty Hunter see dies, a new evil player is shown.
  But if a previously seen evil player is resurrected (Al-Hadikhia) and dies again, does the BH learn another evil player?
A No.

  For example:
  * the BH sees the Godfather on N1
  * the Godfather is executed on D1
  * the BH sees the Mezepheles on N2 and the Godfather is resurrected by the Al-Hadikhia
  * the Godfather is executed again D2
  * N3 the BH does not get a new name, as their current known evil player is still the Mezepheles



========
=Butler=
========
Q If the Butler votes when their master does not, what happens?
A Mechanically, nothing.
  Their vote is still counted, otherwise the total will be less than it should be, automatically hard confirming the Butler, which is unfair for the evil team.
  Also, mistakes happen, just play on for now.
  
  Later, the ST should speak with them privately and remind them of the constraints of their ability,
  and let them know that it is considered cheating to purposefully vote without their master.
  Generally this is enough to keep a player paying more attention,
  because most people are not playing this game in bad faith nor looking to cheat.

  If they keep doing it though, then deal with it however the group would like to deal with cheating.
  Ending the game early, letting it finish but talking about it after, not inviting that person back, etc.
  There is no prescriptive option for what to do with someone who is cheating, as that is a social issue for the group to handle.

Q If the butler thinks they are poisoned or drunk, can they attempt to vote when their master is not voting to test this? /
  Can the Butler vote without their master to test for drunking / poisoning?  
A No, their ability is a social contract that they should abide by always as they have no way of knowing if their ability is functioning or not.
  Voting without their master is cheating and should be dealt with appropriately.

=Cannibal=
==========
Q Could the Cannibal (turned by the Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter) eat the Recluse and guess the Damsel?
A No.

  Evil or good, the Cannibal is not a Minion.

Q If the Cannibal is not sure whether they ate an info gatherer (Fisherman / Savant / ...)
  can the ST just give them false info if the Cannibal asks for it?
A No. If the Cannibal privately asks to use an info ability that they do not have,
  the ST should tell them that they do not have that ability.
  If the Cannibal is poisoned because a player was evil,
  then the ST is allowed to give them false info,
  but should only do so if the evil player was bluffing as that role.

  Publicly claimed abilties like the Slayer, should be entertained in the way that the ST does for anyone else,
  but obviously they would have no effect if the Cannibal did not have the ability.

Q Does the Cannibal gain the role of an executed player that does not die? 
A No.

  The execution must cause the player to die in order for the Cannibal to gain their ability.
  So executing dead players or protected players means the Cannibal does not gain their ability.

Q What does the ST say to the Cannibal when they gain an ability? / Is the Cannibal told what ability they gained?
A The ST never informs the Cannibal of which ability they gain, except for the Butler as per the jinx.

  Instead, the ST does what they would do for the standard character with that ability.
  So they would prompt the player to choose player(s) or a character if that is part of their current ability.
  
  The Cannibal may then infer what ability they have based on what the ST prompts them to do.  Or they could just ask the most recent executee what they are.

Q What happens when the Cannibal eats the Snitch?
A The Minions are woken that night and given three out of play characters which may or may not be the same ones they or the Demon received previously.

Q Could the player Cerenovus targetted to be mad as a certain character claim to be the Cannibal with the ability of that character
  and be safe from a madness break execution?
A No, as the player is not claiming to actually _be_ that character which is the Cerenovus requirement.

Q Does the Zombuul's execution register to the Cannibal?
A Yes, the Cannibal would be poisoned.

Q If the Cannibal gains the Fortune Teller's ability, how would the ST gesture for them to pick two players at night?
A The ST can prompt the Cannibal to choose a player, then wait for them to choose, and then choose a player.

  Alternatively the ST can make the sweeping "choose a player" gesture and then hold two fingers.

  If there is confusion and the ST cannot get them to start the choosing process, writing a note on a phone and showing it to the player is fine.

Q If the Cannibal eats the Alchemist and is shown the Scarlet Woman,
  do they become the good Demon when the Demon is executed the next day,
  or are they the poisoned Cannibal?
A They become the good Demon; the SW ability triggers before the Cannibal can switch abilities.

Q If the Cannibal eats a role that gained another ability (Pixie / Philosopher)
  does she see both roles?
A No, the Cannibal just eats the original role.
  
  The Cannibal does not care what else someone might have gained, just what their token is.

Q What is the Butler jinx with the Cannibal?
A If the Cannibal gains the Butler ability, the Cannibal learns this, otherwise they could break the Butler rules regarding voting without realising.

Q If the Cannibal eats the Spy who registers as a good Townsfolk with a mechanical ability, such as the  Monk or the Gossip), what would happen?
A The Cannibal has that ability so long as the Spy continues to register as good.

Q Can the Cannibal change alignment after eating and gaining the ability of the Goon or the Cult Leader?
A Yes, and if another non-alignment changing player is executed before they change back again, the Cannibal can be locked in as their changed alignment.

Q If the Cannibal is picked by a character checking ability (Dreamer / Gambler / Grandmother / Ravenkeeper / Undertaker / ...) what are they seen as?
A The Cannibal, regardless of the ability they may have gained.

Q The Cannibal gains the ability of the recently killed executee, but what happens if that character is resurrected (Professor / Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / ...)?
A The Cannibal keeps their ability, because they are still the recently killed executee even though they are alive again.
  
Q Does the Cannibal who is resurrected (Professor / Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / ...) still gain the ability of the recently killed executee that night?
A Yes, they immediately gain the relevant ability.

  For example, the Chambermaid is executed and dies, 
  then the Professor resurrects the Cannibal that night, 
  the Cannibal will wake the same night to use the Chambermaid ability,
  even though the Cannibal was dead when the Chambermaid was executed.

Q If an evil Townsfolk or Outsider (Bounty Hunter turned / Mezepheles turned / Cult Leader sat next to an evil player / flipped Goon) is executed, is the Cannibal poisoned?
A Yes, the Cannibal is poisoned by any evil role.

Q How is the Cannibal Juggler ever going to get their info?
A In the case of the Cannibal Juggler, there would have to be no new deaths by execution the day they juggled,
  so that they maintain their Juggler ability to find out the results of their juggle the following night.
  Perhaps town could kindly execute a dead or protected player, instead of someone who is going to die ...

Q The Spy is executed. Tonight, can the Cannibal cause a player to learn that the Cannibal is the Nightwatchman?
A Yes. If the Spy is executed, they may register as any good character and cause the Cannibal to gain any good ability.

Q If the Cannibal gains the Alchemist ability, are they told what Minion ability they have?
A Yes, and that ability does not need to be the original Alchemist's ability, as long as it is also an out of play Minion ability.

Q An evil player is executed and the Cannibal is poisoned. What effect can a Barista 1 have?
A The Cannibal would have the sober and healthy ability of the evil player.
  Sometimes best not done if, for example, the Widow was just executed.
  
Q If a good Demon is executed and there are no other Demons alive, but the Cannibal is in play,
  does the game immediately end or does it continue until the Cannibal no longer has the Demon's ability? 
A The Cannibal with a Demon ability still is not a Demon, so with no Demon alive, the game would end.

Q What happens when the Cannibal eats the Drunk?
A They gain the ability of the Drunk, so the ST deceives the Cannibal that they have any Townsfolk ability, usually whatever the Drunk thought that they had.

  Regardless of what ability the ST pretends they have gained,
  if it is mechanical it cannot have an effect on the game;
  if it is informational, the information is arbitrary.

Q After eating the Drunk, if somoene else dies, does the Cannibal get to eat them or do they stay 'the Drunk'?
A The Cannibal gets to eat them.
  They have the ability of the Drunk, but they are not actually the Drunk so their main Cannibal ability works just fine. 

Q If a player who is scheduled to be Mezepheles turned is executed that day, is the Cannibal still poisoned?
A The Mez can turn a dead player and the Cannibal is a constant check,
  so the Cannibal would become poisoned as soon as the recently executed player turns evil. 

Q If the Cannibal gains the Pixie ability, and the other player dies, does the Cannibal keep the ability after Cannibal swapping?
A When a new player dies from execution, the Cannibal loses the Pixie ability, 
  and in turn loses any other ability they might have gained (although it is very difficult in the first place
  for the Cannibal to gain an ability via the Pixie ability)

Q If a player gains the Nightwatchman ability (Philosopher / Cannibal / Pixie) what are they shown to other players as?
A Nightwatchman.

  The "you" in these kinds of abilities refers to the ability itself.
  As it is the Nightwatchman ability, their target is shown the Nightwatchman token, not the token of the player with the ability.

-------------two in one?
Q The Cannibal wants to ask their Artist question / get their Savant info, but the player that died was good but not actually the Artist/Savant.
  What does the ST answer to the Cannibal-Artist/ Cannibal-Savant question? 
A The ST could reply with something like "I cannot answer that" / "You cannot do that", 
  just as they would to any non-Artist/non-Savant who tries to use a question / get info.

Q The Cannibal Preacher hits a minion. The next day, another player is executed and the Cannibal no longer has the Preacher ability.
  Does the Minion wake and use their ability as normal?
A Yes, the Preacher ability that hampers the Minion is no longer in play.

Q If the Cannibal who was nominated earlier in the game gains the Virgin ability,
  do they cause a Townsfolk who nominates them to be immediately executed?
A Yes, it is a new instance of the ability and the player has not been nominated since getting it, so if a Townsfolk noms them they will be executed.

Q Does the Cannibal with the Savant ability get any hint from the ST that she can get two pieces of information?
A No it is the Cannibal's job to find out what ability she might have by talking to executed players.

Q If the Mutant is executed, could the Cannibal be executed if for some reason they claim that they are an Outsider?
A Yes.

  They can claim to be the Cannibal with the Mutant ability,
  because that is not claiming an Outsider, that is claiming to be the Cannibal (who is a Townsfolk),
  but they are at risk of execution for any Outsider claims. 

Q Does the Demon learn the Cannibal after the Lunatic is executed?
A Yes.  The Cannibal would have the all of the Lunatic's ability, which means the Demon must know that player as their Lunatic, and their choices.

Q What happens when the Cannibal eats the Lunatic?
A The Cannibal is told that they are one of the Demons on the script.
  Some STs will confirm that they are still good, but RAW this is unnecessary.
  The ST takes the Cannibal's kill choices and informs the actual Demon that the Cannibal player is their Lunatic and who they chose.
  The Demon will then immediately know who the Cannibal is.

  If the Cannibal asks what character they are at any point while they have the Lunatic ability,
  they should be told that they are the Demon that they were shown.

  If they lose the Lunatic ability through a further execution,
  then they are treated exactly as they would have been had that execution occurred without a Lunatic execution beforehand.
  They are not told about no longer being a Demon but if they ask what character they are, they should be told that they are the Cannibal, 
  with nothing confirmed about why they were told that they were a Demon.

  All of this assumes that the Cannibal is not droisoned.  If they ate an evil player then they can be lied to about their ability.
  And on a script with the Pit-Hag or the Fang Gu and the Drunk, it is possible for the Cannibal to believe that they really are the Demon.

Q The Cannibal eats the Philosopher, then picks Cannibal so they become drunk.
  Does the drunkenness get removed because they are what drunks themselves?
A Droison loops are resolved by the involved players being droisoned.
  So the Cannibal drunks herself until another player dies by execution.

Q Riot and Cannibal. It states that nominated deaths count as executions for the Cannibal. 
  Does that mean that the Cannibal can potentially have multiple abilities functioning that night 
  and they do not know which ones are being used each time they wake up to use them?
A The Cannibal's ability is still the most recently killed executee, so they only have the one ability at a time, though it may change rapidly as players nominate one another.

Q If the Cannibal eats the Snitch, do Minions gain another three bluffs or do they get nothing?
A They get another three, since there is a new Snitch ability in play.

----------------contradictory?
Q Could the Spy register as good therefore letting the Cannibal see the Grimoire?
A Yes.

Q How does the Cannibal intteract  with the Spy
A The Cannibal cannot legitimately be treated as sober/healthy and having gained the Spy ability without having a legitimately good Spy already.
  The Spy specifically registers as good and as a Townsfolk or Outsider,
  so if the Spy registers as good to the Cannibal, they must also register as a specific Townsfolk/Outsider and the Cannibal would gain that ability instead.

  Still, if the Spy registers as evil, the Cannibal is poisoned and can technically be deceived about anything, 
  including seeing an accurate grimoire!
------------------

Q Could the Cannibal gain a random ability after the Spy dies?
A Yes, the Cannibal could get any good ability,
  though most of the time it is going to make more sense to register the Spy as evil to poison the Cannibal and then making up whatever is relevant.

Q What happens when the Cannibal eats the Recluse?
A The ST has several options:
  * The Recluse registers as a Demon: the Cannibal gains a demon ability! Do not do this.
  * The Recluse registers as evil: the Cannibal is poisoned so the ST can pretend that they have any ability.
  * The Recluse registers as the Recluse: the Cannibal gains the Recluse ability and can register as evil or as a Minion or the Demon to other abilities.

Q If the Cannibal eats the Slayer do they learn they have a shot?
A No, as with the Artist or any other ability that does not wake at night.

Q If the Cannibal eats the Grandmother, when do they get their info?
A After they have had the chance to be drunk, poisoned, and killed.

Q If the Scapegoat, a Traveller, is executed, can the Cannibal gain their ability? 
A Yes. 
  Travellers can get executed due to their ability (the Scapegoat) or madness breaks.
  And if a Traveller instead of being exiled is executed
  then the Cannibal gets that (good) Traveller's ability.
  Unless they were an evil Traveller, in which case the Cannibal is poisoned.

Q If the Cannibal gets the Goon’s ability and then gets selected by an evil player turning them evil,
  then the next day a new player is executed and they get that power, do they stay evil?
A Yes.
  Interactions with the likes of the Goon and the Cult Leader can make evil Cannibals, 
  but does require that the executed role not be evil at the time of their execution,
  else the Cannibal would be poisoned.

  The possibility of too many evils getting created is why the Spirit of Ivory exists.



===========
=Cerenovus=
===========
Q How does madness work if there is a hard confirmed player (Golem / Virgin / ...)
  and the Cerenovus makes another player mad as that player's role?
A It is not necessary for the player be believed as their madness target.
  As long as they make a good show and reasonable effort to convince other players that they are that role and argue against the confirmed player,
  they cannot be executed.  Should they back down then they can be executed for a madness break.

Q Can a player Cerenovus mad as the role that they actually have, 
  claim this and be safe from a madness break execution?
A Often it does lead to execution because of its use as code for "I am not actually this role".

  But a player claiming to be Cerenovus mad as their role is fine
  if the player is making a sincere effort to convince other players that that is what happened; this is fulfilling madness.

Q A good player is Cerenovus mad and breaks madness. The ST decides to not execute for the madness break. 
  The next day the good player is no longer Cerenovous mad.
  Can the ST on any subsequent day execute the good player for the previous madness break?
A The madness due to the Cerenovus ability is in effect until the end of the following night,
  so once that time has passed, their target cannot be executed for breaking madness because it no longer applies to them.
  
  This does mean that after the Cerenovus picks a new madness target, 
  the previous player could still be executed for breaking madness before the end of the night phase,
  but most STs would not do this as night executions usually make little sense.

Q Can the self mad Cerenovus be executed for breaking madness?
A Yes, but it is probably best not to if it is final three so as not be too harmful to the good team.

Q Can the Cerenovus mad player claim to be the Philosopher turned into a good role, or does the play need to directly claim the good role?
A The player must try to convince people that they are that role, not that they just have that ability.
  Otherwise, they can be executed for a madness break.
  It is up to the ST if they want to execute for breaking madness it that way, since it can be viewed as a more minor break, but it is still going against madness.

Q If a player is Cerenovus mad, dies, and then breaks madness in death, can they be executed?
A Yes.

Q If a player is Cerenovus mad as the Butler, but votes when their claimed master does not, can the voting be cut off and she be executed for breaking madness immediately?
A If the ST thinks that she is not being mad as the Butler, she may be executed.
  It could happen immediately though it is almost certainly better to at least wait until the vote is finished.

Q Suppose the Cerenovus maddens a dead player, to either maintain confusion or waste an execution.
  Someone else is executed; is it allowed for the mad player to break madness immediately after the announcement?
  Technically they will remain mad until the Cere's night order, but there is no longer a downside in breaking it.
  Is it cheating (so the ST could punish it by executing them tomorrow anyway),
  or maybe maddening a dead player is strong and can be taken down a notch, or maybe Cere can counterplay by maddening them again?
A Executions can occur at night and it is a legal way to punish good sometimes.
  But as they are already dead, this will cause them to simply die, or well, nothing will happen.
  It might be best for the ST to not execute them to confirm nothing.

Q Is a player claiming there is a Cerenovus while they are mad (but still pretending to be the character that they are supposed to be mad about) breaking madness?
A Not inherently, but madness is really subjective and context dependent.

Q If the Slayer who has been targeted by the Cerenovus publically claims Slayer, can she be executed for a madness break before she shoots?
A Yes.

=============
=Chambermaid=
=============
Q Does the King register to the Chambermaid?
A Not unitl the dead outnumber the living.  After that point he begins to wake up to receive his info and will start to register to the Chambermaid.

Q Does the Damsel waking to learn that they have been turned into a Townsfolk register to the Chambermaid?
A Only if they wake due to their new ability, since players waking to learn that they are a new character is is not waking due to their own ability.  

Q Does the Pit-Hag who turns himself into a non-waking character register to the Chambermaid?
A Yes. That player woke to an ability that they had at some point that night.

Q What number does the Chambermaid learn if they pick the Demon and the Snaker Charmer on the night that they swapped roles?
A 1. The starting SC woke to charm the Demon, then as the new Demon they killed.  The starting Demon did not wake to their own ability.

Q Does the Cannibal gaining a night-waking ability and waking to use it, register to the Chambermaid?
A Yes.

Q What is the Al-Hadikhia jinx with the Chambermaid?
A The Al-Hadikhia's targets do not register as waking, if they would not otherwise wake,
  because it is due to the Al-Hadikhia ability that they are waking.

Q Do "start knowing" roles, like the Grandmother learning their grandchild, register on their first night to the Chambermaid?
A Yes, they woke up to their own ability.

Q Does waking a Minion to tell them the Damsel is in play register to the Chambermaid?
A No, that is not waking due to their ability.

Q If the Chambermaid chooses someone who died that same night, are they told to choose another player?
A Yes.  That will reveal to the Chambermaid one of their picks died,
  but the death is declared in the morning before anyone else should be talking so it does not matter.

Q If the good Mezepheles turns themselves evil that night, does that count as a +1 to the Chambermaid?
A Yes, they woke up due to their own ability.

Q The Snake Charmer picks the Demon. The Chambermaid checks the new Demon, who did not wake as a part of the Demon's ability, but as a part of the Snake Charmer's ability.
  Is that a +1 to the Chambermaid?
A Yes.
  They were at one point in the night the Snake Charmer who woke as the Snake Charmer,
  which counts as waking to your own ability,
  so it is a Chambermaid +1.

Q If the Demon is selected by the Exorcist, their waking to learn the Exorcist is not reflected in the Chambermaid's number,
  since they are waking due to the Exorcist's ability.
  However, if the Recluse registering as the Demon is selected by the Exorcist, 
  then them waking to see the Exorcist is caused by the Exorcist's ability or their own,
  since it was their own mis-registration that allowed them to wake?
A They woke to the Exorcist’s ability so it does not register to the Chambermaid.
  They are not being tricked into believing something fake (like the Lunatic for instance), so it is not their own ability.
  The Exorcist still did choose them and directly cause their waking.

Q If someone wakes and chooses not to use their ability (Professor / Philosopher / Courtier / ...) does it register to the Chambermaid?
A Yes, they still woke to their own ability.
  If a player has a once-per-game ability,
  they wake up each night for their own ability so that they can choose to use it or not.
  Once it is used, they stop waking up.

  Under Tips and Tricks for the Chambermaid:
  "Pick players to verify their claims.
  If someone is claiming to be the Gambler, they will wake up every night - check them and see if they are being honest.
  As another example, someone claiming to be a Courtier will only wake up each night until they have used their ability
  - if they are claiming to have used their ability,
  you can check to see if that is true by seeing if they wake up the next night!"

Q Who can the Chambermaid pick if they are alive in a final two, where the Zombuul is registering as dead?
  The Chambermaid must pick two alive players but cannot pick themselves and there is only one other alive player.
A They do not get any info.
  There is no need to even wake them.

Q Does a Minion learning they are now the Imp alert the Chambermaid?
A No. They are not waking to their own ability.

  Telling a player their character has changed is not an ability's action, it is game mechanics.

Q Does a Minion / the Demon waking up to learn their new role after an Engineer swap ping the Chambermaid?
A Only if they wake due to their new ability.

Q Does a new instance of the Evil Twin learning their twin ping the Chambermaid?
A Yes.  Learning that they are now the Evil Twin does not ping the Chambermaid,
  but waking due to their ability to know their twin is a Chambermaid +1.

Q Does any character waking to learn of a change in alignment count for the Chambermaid, or just the Goon and the Cult Leader?
A The Chambermaid only learns if the character woke due to their own power. So a Mezepheles turning someone, for example, does not count for the Chambermaid.

Q Does the Goon waking to learn she switched alignment register to the Chambermaid?
  And if the Goon is already the same alignment as what she would have changed to, does it count for the Chambermaid?
A If the Goon wakes to learn their alignment changed due to her ability,
  then this registers to the Chambermaid.
  If she did not change alignment because the first person to pick her has the same alignment,
  then she would not have woken so no registering to the Chambermaid.
  If the Goon changes alignment through other means than their ability, such as Mezepheles,
  then this waking does not register to the Chambermaid.

Q Can the Chambermaid ping falsely off of misregistering characters (Spy / Recluse)?
A No, they correctly learn that the Spy wakes and the Recluse does not.

  Misregistration does not grant the abilities nor the waking pattern of the misregistered role.
  * The Spy who is alive and sees the Grimoire woke to their own ability, and misregistration cannot change this fact or stop the Chambermaid from getting a correct ping.
  * The Recluse who misregisters as the Demon does not actually wake up to kill and does not incorrectly ping the Chambermaid.

Q Does the Scarlet Woman only count for waking for the Chambermaid's ability when they become the Demon?
A Yes. But the ST might consider their waking up when the Imp self-kills is due to the Imp's ability, not the SW's ability, and not ping the Chambermaid.

Q Do the Drunk, Marionette and the Lunatic, who in reality do not have the ability that they think they have, "wake at night due to their own ability" for the Chambermaid?
A Yes.

Q The Lunatic wakes up to falsely learn a player is the Exorcist that selected them. Does this ping the Chambermaid?
A Yes, as the waking is due to their own ability.

Q Do Minions, the Demon and the Lunatic getting their N1 info count as waking to the Chambermaid?
A Only in the case of the Lunatic.

  The Chambermaid detects if a player woke up for their character ability, and Minion and Demon info are a function of character type, not character ability.
  In contrast, the Lunatic, who wakes up to receive Demon info is detected by the Chambermaid
  because they are not actually a Demon and did wake up due to their own ability.


======
=Chef=
======
Q With the seating of Demon-Recluse-Minion-Minion, what could the Chef be shown?
A The Chef number could be any of 1, 2, or 3 with this seating, as the Recluse can register as good and evil for separate instances of the Chef ability.

==========
=Choirboy=
==========
Q What does the Choirboy learn in a Lil' Monsta game?
A The Choirboy would be shown the person babysitting Lil’ Monsta the rest of that night
  and the next day because Lil’ Monsta’s kill and therefore the Choirboy’s information comes after the babysitter is chosen.

Q If the Pukka targets the King and then the following night picks the Choirboy, does the Choirboy get poisoned info?
A Yes.

  The King would die as the previously poisoned player after the Pukka makes their next pick.
  That pick being the Choirboy means that they are poisoned when they awake and can therefore receive arbitrary info, before dying the following night.

Q If the Spy is killed by the Demon, could they misregister as the King and cause the Choirboy to learn the Demon's identity?
A Yes, but that would probably not be fun for anyone.

Q If a multi-kill Demon (Al-Hadikhia / Po / Shabaloth) chooses the Choirboy after the King as part of the same selection, can the Choirboy learn the Demon?
A Yes.  Order matters: if the King dies then the Choirboy is woken and told the Demon player, even if the Choirboy then dies later as part of the same selection.

Q What does the Choirboy see in a Legion game?
A Any of the living Legion players.

Q Could the Choirboy be shown the Recluse after the King is killed by the Demon?
A Yes, though that is unlikely to be a fair move,
  especially if the Choirboy’s convincingly bluffed something else so the Demon does not think the Choirboy is in play.

Q Can the King be the Drunk or the Marionette if the Choirboy is in play?
A No, that would be an illegal setup.

  If the player who thinks they are the King is actually the Drunk or the Marionette,
  then the King is out of play and the Choirboy's [setup ability] has not been satisfied.
  
  To avoid situations where the Demon is sat between a Minion and the King, leaving no valid Marionette, 
  the ST should use an alternative setup.
  
Q Can the Choirboy be the Drunk or the Marionette if the King is in play?
A Yes, this is a legitimate setup, 
  where the King has not been forced into play by the Choirboy, they are there by their own right.

Q If the Choirboy is in the game, the King is not allowed to be the Drunk or the Marionette,
  but is it possible to have the King turned evil by the Bounty Hunter?
A Yes.

Q In a two Minion game on a script with the Marionette, the King, and the Choirboy, after the roles are randomly assigned,
  the Demon ends up neighbouring one Minion and the King, who must become the Marionette, but the Choirboy is still in play.
  An illegal setup!  How can this be avoided?  Remove the King from the bag and put it back later as you do in a three Minion game?
A The better move is to not have the Demon in the bag. 
  Switching someone's token to the King would let a good player know an out of play role.

Q If the King is killed then resurrected (Professor / Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / ...) then dies again, does the Choirboy get their info each time?
A The Choirboy learns the Demon each time the King is killed by the Demon.

Q If the King is Barber swapped with a dead player, does the Choirboy get their info?
A No, the King was not killed by the Demon.

Q If the King is killed by a non Demon (Gossip / Lycanthrope / Virgin / Moonchild / Assassin / Cerenovus / Godfather / Pit-Hag / Witch / Apprentice / Butcher / Gunslinger / Harlot / Judge / ...),
  does the Choirboy learn the Demon?
A No, except if the player that kills the King is holding Lil’ Monsta at the time and so registers as the Demon.

Q The Demon kill bounces off the Mayor to the King.  Does the Choirboy get their info?
A Yes.  A bounce off the Mayor is treated as full redirection of the entire ability,
  so it is as if the Demon directly chose the King.

Q Who does the Choirboy learn if the Vortox kills the King?
A Any non-Demon player.

Q If the single Minion in a game is the Spy registering as a Townsfolk/Outsider, what is the Clockmaker told? /
  What is the Clockmaker told if the Kazali chooses as their single Minion the player who is the Soldier?
A When there is no way to get a step count between the Minion and the Demon, 
  the ST shakes their head to indicate that there is no valid info.

Q Can the Clockmaker learn a zero?
A If the Clockmaker sees either no Demons or no Minions, the ST simply shakes their head to indicate there is no valid information to give and puts her back to sleep.
  The only way for the Clockmaker to learn a zero is if they are poisoned, drunk, or Vortox’d,
  but it would be an immediate giveaway that they are one of those things due to it normally being impossible.
  Outside of SnV, a one minion game with the Spy can give the Clockmaker a no.

Q What is the interaction between the Recluse and the Clockmaker?
A The Recluse can register as a Minion or a Demon to make a smaller Clockmaker number than there should be,
  but if a Minion and a Demon were sat right next to each other the ST could not use the Recluse to give a larger number to the Clockmaker.

Q If the Clockmaker is created mid game (Philosopher / Pit-Hag / Barber / Pixie / Cannibal / ..), do dead players count as spaces?
A Yes.

Q Does the Clockmaker count Travellers when calculating steps?
A Yes, as the Clockmaker counts "the number of seated players".

==========
=Courtier=
==========
Q Can an ability gaining character (Philosopher / Cannibal / Pixie) be drunked if the Courtier chooses the character whose ability was gained?
A No.  Gaining the ability of a character does not make a player that character, they remain the character on their token.

Q The Courtier chooses to drunk an out of play Minion.  However the Alchemist has that Minion's ability.  Is the Alchemist drunked?
A No.  The Courtier drunks a character and if they are out of play, no one is drunked.
  While the Alchemist has a Minion ability, they are not that Minion, they are the Alchemist, so they are not drunked.

Q If the Courtier drunked Demon dies turning the SW, is the new Demon also Courtier drunked?
A No, the Courtier drunkenness does not migrate; it stays on the targeted player.
  Courtier essentially uses the character to choose the player.

Q What happens if the Courtier drunked player changes character?
A They stay Courtier drunk as once it has happened, the drunkenness is tied to the player.

Q What is the interaction between the Courtier and the Lunatic?
A The Lunatic is still deceived that they are the Demon, but the actual Demon does not learn the Lunatic's choices.

Q If there are multiple copies of the same character in play (Legion / Village Idiot / Imp / Fang Gu / ...) and the Courtier chooses that character,
  are they all drunked?
A Just one. The ST chooses one player with that character to become drunk.

Q What happens when a Courtier is drunk or poisoned while their ability is active? Does the day still tick by, or is their ability effectively paused while droisoned?
A If the Courtier was sober/healthy when they used their ability, then their token is placed down. 
  If they become drunk/poisoned then, while they are droisoned, their target is no longer Courtier-drunk.
  If they become health/sober again before the three days run out, the target is once again drunk.
  While the Courtier is droisoned, the timer continues to count down,
  so if the timer runs out before they become sober/healthy again, the target is simply not going to be re-drunked by the Courtier.

Q The Courtier drunks an out of play character that then comes in to play (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Engineer / ...).  Is the player with that character now drunked?
A No. The Courtier's drunkenness is applied, or not, to a player at the time of the choice, and will not change after the fact even if characters are changed.

Q If the Courtier dies before the three days are over, does the drunkness end?
A Yes, unless otherwise stated, players lose their ability on death, so any drunkenness caused by the Courtier ends when she dies.

Q The Courtier drunks the Leviathan and for three days players execute good players with no fear.
  What happens when the Leviathan becomes sober? Evil team wins?
A Assuming the Courtier remains sober, healthy and alive then:
  If N1 the Courtier hits the Leviathan (at which point, town actually do not know it is a Leviathan game, because making the Leviathan drunk suppresses the announcement).
  then only on day 4 is the announcement made, and the Leviathan has seen nothing,
  meaning the good team has two chances left to hit the Leviathan, 
  or loses because of time (since it will be the end of Day 5 after the second execution).
  If N2 the Leviathan is drunked,
  then she will need to be executed on day 5 or good will lose on time/executions.
  If the Leviathan is drunked any later point than that,
  then good loses as soon as the Levi is sober. 

Q Can the Courtier drunk fabled characters?
A No.

  The Courtier drunks players with the character that they pick, 
  and as no player can be assigned a fabled character, only those listed on the character sheet,
  the Courtier is unable to drunk a fabled character.

Q If the Cannibal Courtier chooses the Demon, but then a non-Courtier is executed, will the Demon become sober?
A Yes.


=============
=Cult Leader=
=============
Q Can the Recluse registering as evil turn the Cult Leader evil?
A Yes.

Q On N1, could the Cult Leader sat between two good players be turned evil by the Bounty Hunter then turn good again due to their own ability?
A Yes.

Q Is the Cult Leader locked as evil if they die evil?
A Yes, unless their ability reactivates (Professor / Bone Collector / Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia).

Q By dawn, the sober, healthy Cult Leader, the Demon, and a Minion are alive. Mechanically, must the game be over?
A No. The Cult Leader does not know who the Demon is for sure and could possibly still accidentally nominate the Demon and lose.

Q What happens when the Cult Leader says the Mezepheles word?
A If the Cult Leader is evil, nothing happens.

  If the Cult Leader is good and is the first good player to say the Mez word, she turns evil that night.
  The Cult Leader still has her own ability, so may turn good or evil according to her neighbours.
  Interestingly the Cult Leader acts after the Mez in the night order, so she may switch from good to evil, then back to good in the same night.

Q If the Cult Leader changes their alignment, do they learn that immediately that night?
A Yes.

Q If the Cult Leader is turned evil by the Mezepheles, can they later turn good again with their own ability?
A Yes.



========
=Damsel=
========
Q Does a Minion created mid game learn that the Damsel is in play?
A Yes, assuming the Damsel is alive, sober and healthy.

Q Can the Damsel player be seen by the Balloonist twice, first as an Outsider and then, post-Huntsman-transformation, as a Townsfolk?
A Yes.

Q If the Courtier drunks the Damsel, what happens when the Damsel is chosen by the Huntsman?
A The Damsel becomes a Townsfolk and, since they are no longer the Damsel, they are no longer Courtier drunked.

Q After the Damsel is transformed by the Huntsman, what do character checking abilities (Dreamer/Gambler/Ravenkeeper/Undertaker/Harlot/...) see?
A The see the new character post-transformation, not the Damsel.

Q The Huntsman transforms the Damsel into a Townsfolk.  The former Damsel is Barber swapped with another player.  Does the other player become the Damsel?
A No, they become what the character that the former Damsel became, as the Damsel has changed, not just gained an ability.

Q Can the Huntsman-transformed-Damsel be Fang Gu jumped?
A No, as they are no longer an Outsider.

Q If the Huntsman-transformed-Damsel is executed, does the Godfather get a kill that night?
A No, as they are no longer an Outsider.

Q Can the Damsel be the Marionette if the Huntsman is in play?
A No, but the Huntsman is allowed to be the Marionette.

Q Can the Damsel who is hosting the Lleech still be transformed by the Huntsman?
A Yes, and they continued to be poisoned.

Q Does a correctly guessed Damsel change character twice if they have been Barista doubled?
A No.

Q If the Philosopher picks the ability of an out of play character, then the Damsel is turned by the Huntsman into that character, what happens?
A The ex-Damsel is drunked by the Philo.

Q What happens when an evil Townsfolk or Outsider (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter / ...) guesses the Damsel?
A Nothing, because they are not a Minion. The guess is not used.

Q The Huntsman guesses the Cannibal / Philosopher with the Damsel ability as the Damsel.  Is that player turned?
A No, having the Damsel ability does not make the player the Damsel.

Q If a new instance of the Damsel enters play (Cannibal / Philosopher / ...), do the Minions get a fresh Damsel Ping?
A No, they already knew the Damsel was in play so they are not informed again; 
  the announcement is once per game no matter how many instances of the Damsel or their ability are created.

Q If a new instance of the Damsel enters play (Cannibal / Philosopher / ...), can the Minions guess the Damsel again if they previously used their guess?
A Yes.  But as they are not reinformed of the Damsel being in play they may not realise they have a fresh guess.

Q What happens if, after the Cannibal eats the Damsel, a Minion guesses the Cannibal as the Damsel?
A Evil wins.

Q In order to correctly guess the Philosopher Damsel or the Cannibal Damsel, what does a Minion have to say? "X is the Philo/Cannibal" or "X is the Damsel" or either?
A A Minion must guess "X is the Damsel".

  The "you" in abilities always refers to the player's ability, not their character.

Q If the Damsel is drunk (Puzzlemaster / Courtier / Sailor / ...) do the Minions not get informed?
A Puzzlemaster drunking would prevent the Minions learning the Damsel, as the Damsel is drunked during N1 setup.
  Other sources of drunking act after the Minion info step in the night order so cannot prevent the Minions learning the Damsel.
  
  With that understood, using the Puzzlemaster to drunk the Damsel is not recommended. 

Q What stops players from insisting that everyone publicly guesses themselves as the Damsel to prove that they are not a Minion to to waste the Damsel guess?
A The ST is advised to ignore any forced statements.

Q Does each Minion get an individual Damsel guess?
A No.  The Minions collectively get one guess.

Q In a base two Outsiders game with the Huntsman, and no other Outsider manipulation, how many Outsiders comprise a legal setup?
A Two or three:
  * two if the Damsel is one of the regular base two Outsiders
  * three if the Damsel replaces a Townsfolk, i.e. adding the Damsel with the Huntsman on top of the normal Outsider count.
  
  Most players prefer it if the Damsel replaces one of the regular Outsiders rather than a Townsfolk for fun and balance purposes,
  but it is fine to do it sometimes.

Q Can the evil Apprentice guess the Damsel.
A No, they may have a Minion ability, but they are not a Minion.

Q What happens if the Damsel is resurrected (Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / ...)?
A The Minions are not reinformed about the Damsel, as it is a once per game announcement.
  However, if there is a new Minion who has not previously been informed they would be informed,
  in which case it is best to not resurrect the Damsel using the Shabaloth.
 
  If guesses have been made previous to the Damsel resurrection,
  they do not count for this new instance of the Damsel ability,
  so the Minions have one more opportunity to guess the Damsel.
  
Q If the Damsel is chosen by the Bone-Collector, what happens?
A The Minions are not reinformed about the Damsel, as it is a once per game announcement.
  However, if there is a new Minion who has not previously been informed they would be informed.

  If guesses have been made previous to the Damsel's bones being collected,
  they do not count for this new instance of the Damsel ability,
  so the Minions have one more opportunity to guess the Damsel.

Q Does a Minion babysitting Lil' Monsta, therefore registering as the Demon, still learn if the Damsel is in play?
A Yes.

Q Can a Minion babysitting Lil' Monsta's guess the Damsel?
A Yes.

Q Can a Legion player guess the Damsel?
A Yes, as Legion players register as Minions.

Q Can the Witch who has lost their ability at three players left alive still guess the Damsel?
A Yes.

Q What is the Damsel jinx with the Spy?
A This is a hate jinx: only one of these characters can be in play.

Q What is the Damsel jinx with the Widow?
A This is a hate jinx: only one of these characters can be in play.

Q Can an Imp who was a Minion guess the Damsel?
A No.

Q Can the Damsel be the good twin to the Evil Twin?
A Yes ... but that could end the game very quickly!
  This might be a good idea if the Courtier or the Heretic are on the script,
  so that instantly guessing the Damsel is not the automatic best move to make.

Q If the Damsel is Barber swapped to another player, do the Minions get another Damsel announcement?
A No, it is a once per game announcement.
  
  However, if a player is swapped into having a Minion character and was not one previously, then they are told about the Damsel.

  This can result in a very bad day for the evil team if the Damsel is swapped with a Minion,
  as the good ex-Damsel-now-Minion knows somewhere there is an evil Damsel and,
  based on whether they are told that the Damsel is in play, would know whether the evil now-Damsel is alive or not and whether they can therefore be guessed to win the game.

Q Does the Monk protecting the Damsel prevent an evil win should a Minion make a correct guess?
A No, unless in the unlikely situation where the Minion is holding Lil' Monsta and guesses at night.
 
  The Monk protects against the Demon, not Minions, and only at night,
  so Monk protection does not prevent a correct Minion guess of a Damsel ending the game.  

Q Does the Poppy Grower stop the Minions learning that the Damsel is in the game?
A No.

Q Can a preached Minion still make a successful Damsel guess?
A Yes, a Minion with no ability is still a Minion.

Q Does the Magician learn that there is a Damsel in the game?
A No, they are not actually a Minion, nor can they guessing the Damsel have any effect.

Q Can the dead Damsel still be chosen?
A No, once they are dead they lose their ability. Conversely, a dead Minion could choose a living Damsel.

Q If the poisoned Damsel is correctly guessed by a Minion, does their team still lose?
A No. If a Minion claims Minion and guesses the Damsel while the Damsel is drunk or poisoned, the game continues and the guess is used up.

Q Do Minions get informed of the drunk/poisoned Damsel during N1?
A Yes.

Q If the Damsel is in play, when do Minions learn it?
A During Minion info.

Q If a good Minion is created while the Damsel is in play, will they be informed that the Damsel is in play?
A Yes.

Q If the Marionette thinks they are the Damsel, do the other Minions learn that the Damsel is in play?
A No.

Q What is the Marionette/Damsel jinx?
A The Marionette does not learn the Damsel is in play.

Q Can the Minions Damsel guess at night?
A Yes.


==================
=Devil's Advocate=
==================
Q Is the self-protecting Devil's Advocate who became the new Imp after the previous one self-killed, safe from execution tomorrow?
A No.  After becoming the Imp, the Devil's Advocate became out of play so the protection is gone.

Q Can the Devil’s Advocate protect from a execution due to  breaking madness (Mutant / Cerenovus)?
A Yes.

Q If the Devil’s Advocate protects the Zombuul and then the Zombuul kills themself the same night, does the protection remain or disappear?
A It remains, so double tapping the Zombuul player that day will not end the game!

Q Is there a way for the Devil's Advocate to protect the same player for two days in a row?
A A new instance of the DA, created via the Barber swap, is free to choose whomever they want, which could be the same player the previous DA chose.

Q There are three players alive at the end of the day: the Pukka, the Devil's Advocate and the Sailor. 
  At night the Sailor chooses the DA and the ST makes the DA drunk.
  The DA chooses to protect the Pukka and the Pukka chooses the Sailor, making them poisoned.
  The next day the Pukka is executed. Does the Pukka die?
A Yes, because at the time the DA chose to protect the Pukka the DA was drunk, so they did not protect the Pukka. 

-------------combine
Q If the DA chooses the Goon and gets drunked, and then the Goon is removed from the game by the Pit-Hag, does the protection remain on the player,
  or not since DA was drunk at the moment?
A Not, as the token was never placed down in the first place because the DA was drunk so there is nothing that can "come back" so to speak.

Q If the Devil's Advocate is drunk / poisoned at the time they choose who to protect,
  then become sober / healthy before dawn,
  is there pick safe from execution?
A No.  At their turn in the night order, the DA's ability fails to protect their pick, and no reminder token would have placed,
  so the fact that they became sober / healthy is immaterial.

===========
=Doomsayer=
===========
Q There are four players left alive and the only living good player uses the Doomsayer.  Is the game over?
A Yes. If you are the only living player of your alignment and you doomsay, you die.

Q Can the Doomsayer kill the invoking player?
A Yes.

Q Can the Spy invoking the Doomsayer kill a good player?
A Yes, the Recluse and the Spy, due to registering as good or evil, can result in a Doomsayer death of any alignment.
  The Spy and the Recluse can also both die to anyone using the Doomsayer as well.
  The Storyteller can make use of this for game balance.


=========
=Dreamer=
=========
Q What are considered to be 'good' and 'evil' roles
  when the Dreamer targets an evil Townsfolk / Outsider or a good Minion / Demon
  (Bounty Hunter / Mezepheles / Pit-Hag / Barber / ...)?
A "Good character" and "evil character" actually have definitions in the game that are not about the alignment of the player:
  * "Good" characters are Townsfolk and Outsiders - blue tokens.
  * "Evil" characters are Demons and Minions - red tokens.

  So the Dreamer is always shown a Townsfolk / Outsider for one character and a Minion / Demon for the other:
  * the Mezepheles-turned Townsfolk is still Dreamer seen as that Townsfolk token correctly or any Minion/Demon token incorrectly, even though they are now evil;
  * a good Minion could be seen as any Townsfolk/Outsider incorrectly and their Minion token correctly.

Q Could the Dreamer who picked the Recluse see a character other than the Recluse for their good character?
A Yes.

Q Can the Dreamer choose the same player repeatedly?
A Yes, the Dreamer's only restriction is not themselves and not Travellers.
  Picking the same player would likely result in the ST giving them the same answers,
  unless the demon switches to/from the Vortox or drunking / poisoning is involved.




=======
=Drunk=
=======
Q Must the Drunk believe that they are an out of play Townsfolk?
A No.

  The Drunk must be believe that they are a Townsfolk which at setup is achieved by substituting the Drunk token with another Townsfolk token.
  It is due to the physical limitations of the game that the Drunk tends to see an out of play Townsfolk; most roles only come with one token.
  Village Idiot is an exception.
  However, should the Drunk be created mid game they can legally see an in play token, although they probably should not.

Q Can an Outsider be the Drunk?
A An Outsider can be drunk but they cannot be _the_ Drunk, as the Drunk must believe that they are a Townsfolk.

Q Is the character that the Marionette or the Drunk thinks that they are considered "in play"?
A No.

Q If the Philosopher chooses the Drunk, what happens with the philo-drunk Drunk? / What happens if the Drunk is poisoned or drunked?
A Nothing.

  Any drunk or poisoned player is deceived that their ability is still working.
  The Drunk's ability is that they believe that they are a Townsfolk, so they just get treated like the Townsfolk they think they are.

Q Does the dead Drunk have an ability? For example, the Drunk who thinks that they are the Ravenkeeper.
A The Drunk who believes they are the Ravenkeeper is woken when they die.

Q Is the Drunk affected by the Vortox?
A _The_ Drunk is actually an Outsider, deceived into thinking that they are a Townsfolk,
  and Outsiders are not affected by the Vortox's ability.
  So the information the Drunk gets from the ability they think they have is not affected by Vortox, and can be true.

  However, in a game with a (healthy, sober and alive) Vortox, the drunk or poison status of Townsfolk is irrelevant - their abilities must yield false info.

Q On a script with (say) the Pit-Hag (or even the Barber) 
  it is legal to tell the Drunk that they have changed character to a different Townsfolk, because it still satisfies the 'you think you are a Townsfolk'-part of 'the Drunk'?
A Yes, as long as the ST makes them still think that they are a Townsfolk, it is fine to deceive them into thinking they changed. It is real fun to make them think they got turned into the Farmer sometimes.

Q Can the ST tell the Drunk that they turned into another Townsfolk character to the one they currently believe they are, to simulate the Pit-Hag?
A Yes.

Q The Drunk/Marionette thinks they are a Townsfolk, and wakes up to falsely to learn that they are the Farmer.  Does this ping the Chambermaid?
A Yes, as the waking is due to their own ability.

Q When does the ST decide who the Drunk character is? / Can the ST decide which character the Drunk is after the tokens are distributed?
A If the character has setup abilities that could change the Outsiders (Huntsman / Balloonist)
  then it should be decided that they will be the Drunk before tokens go in the bag,
  because the Drunk does not have the setup ability that would change the Outsider count.
  This decision cannot then change after token distribution.

  Otherwise it is up to the ST.
  Most STs assign the Drunk once tokens have been handed out and know the grim, allowing them to balance the game much better.
  The entry for the Drunk states "while preparing the first night", which would be once tokens are already handed out.
  But it is also fine for the ST to decide beforehand to make the Drunk a specific character regardless of token distribution.

Q If the Drunk or the Marionette is Pit-Hagged into play, can they be shown an already in play character?
A Yes, it is just on setup that the Drunk and the Marionette cannot see a role already in play.

Q Can the Drunk think that they are an in play character?
A At the start of the game no, unless it is a Bootlegger game or a it is a character which can start with multiples in play (Village Idiot).
  A mid game created Drunk (Pit-Hag / Barber) can legally be shown an in play character, but probably should not.

Q Is the Drunk, drunk?
A Yes.
  The Drunk registers as drunk to any abilities that are concerned with drunkeness.
  So the healthy and sober Acrobat that neighbours the living Drunk will die.

Q Does gaining the Drunk's ability (Cannibal / Philosopher) make the player drunk, triggering the Acrobat's death?
A Yes.

  As the Drunk registers as drunk for the Acrobat, any player gaining the Drunk ability does too.


========
=Empath=
========
Q Does the Empath learn their neighbour even if they die at night?
A No, the Empath only learns their living neighbours at their turn in the night order.

==========
=Engineer=
==========
Q What happens when there are multiple instances of the Demon (Fang Gu / Imp) when the Engineer picks the new Demon?
A All Demon players change character.

Q Are evil Townsfolk or Outsiders (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter / ...) affected by the Engineer's picks?
A No, only the Minions or the Demon.

Q Can the Recluse misregister when the Engineer is picking the Demon or the Minions?
A Yes, but don't.

  Registering the Recluse as a Minion or as the Demon could cause them to be changed by the Engineer, or affect which characters are changed.
  But the Recluse is an Outsider so it is best not to use their ability like this.

Q The Bounty Hunter is in play, and the Engineer is evil. 
  The three Minions decide to pass Lil' Monsta to the Engineer.
  The Engineer changes the Demon. 
  Does this game now have three Minions and one Demon?
A Yes, the current babysitter becomes the Demon. Their alignment does not change, so they remain evil.

Q The Pit-Hag turns himself into an evil Townsfolk, then the Engineer chooses which Minions exist.  Does the ex PH turn back into a Minion?
A No, the ex PH remains an evil Townsfolk.
  The Engineer does not change character types; the ST accepts however many Minions she picks to not make it obvious, but only makes use of the first few.
  so the Engineer would simply fail to create whatever Minion she chose.

Q Can the Engineer affect the Alchemist's Minion ability?
A If the Engineer causes the Alchemist to have an in play Minion ability,
  then the Alchemist will need to swap to an out of play one.
  Otherwise, the Alchemist is not affected by the Engineer, as they are not themselves a Minion, they just have a Minion ability.

Q What is the Legion jinx with the Engineer?
A Legion and the Engineer cannot both be in play at the start of the game.
  If the Engineer creates Legion, most players (including all evil players) become evil Legion.

Q Can the Engineer choose Lil' Monsta to be in play?
A Yes, the former Demon becomes an out of play Minion of the ST's choice and is babysitting Lil’ Monsta.

Q What happens to the babysitter if the Engineer swaps Lil' Monsta to another Demon?
A The current babysitter becomes that Demon instead of whatever character they were previously.
 
Q What does the Marionette learn if they are swapped to another Minion by the Engineer?
A They would be shown the "you are" info token and their new Minion character.
  They would be told nothing about their alignment as it has not changed.


===========
=Evil Twin=
===========
Q The Townsfolk neighbour sat next to the No Dashii is turned by the Pit-Hag into the Evil Twin.
  What info do they receive?
A They are now a good Minion, so the No Dashii poisoning moves past them to the next Townsfolk player.
  As they are now no longer poisoned, they are correctly told their twin: an evil player and their role.

Q Does the game end if the only two players that are alive are the twins?
A Yes, evil wins.

  Although no win conditions have been met in that scenario 
  STs usually end the game if the Demon and the two twins are still alive as it is basically impossible for good to win at that point.
  Evil does not explicitly require the Demon to survive to final two to win.
  They just usually do, since good wins if there are no alive Demons.
  But the Evil Twin specifically prevents that win from happening so long as both twins are alive.
  So despite the Demon being dead, as only two players left alive is evil's win condition, evil wins.

Q Could the twins ever get bad information?
  i.e. is it possible that they think the other twin is someone else other than their actual twin?
A The Sweetheart drunked player who is turned into the Evil Twin would learn wrong info,
  but would not cause anyone else to wake though, so only the drunk ET would get wrong info in this scenario.

Q If the Evil Twin ability is not active (Courtier drunking / Preacher / ...) when the good twin is executed,
  do evil instantly win when the ET's ability resumes functioning?
A No, the good twin was executed while the ET ability was malfunctioning and it does not trigger retroactively.
  However, re-executing the good twin would trigger the regained ET ability.

Q If the Demon dies and the game continues due to the Evil Twin, what happens if the ET loses their ability (Courtier / Preacher / ...)?
A With no living Demon the good team instantly wins when the ET loses their ability.

Q The Evil Twin knows the role of a twinned good player.
  If the Pit-Hag turns a good player into the Evil Twin,
  does the resulting good aligned Evil Twin know the role of their twinned evil player?
A Yes.

Q Does the Evil Twin find out if their twin changes character (Pit-Hag / Barber ?
A Yes, the Evil Twin always knows the ability of their good twin, so should be immediately informed of their new character.

  However, if the Evil Twin is turned into something else the good twin does not learn this.

Q The Pit-Hag turns a good player into the Evil Twin, who is then twinned with an evil player. 
  If the evil player is killed does that cause another evil player to become the evil aligned twin,
  since the Evil Twin is still alive and needs a counterpart?
A No. The twins only change if the _alignment_ of one of them changes. It is allowable to have a dead twin.

Q The Evil Twin is N1 drunked / poisoned.  How should the ST run this?
A The ET is decieved as to their ability working, so they are told an arbitrary player and a character.
  The actual good twin learns nothing.
  When the ET is sober and healthy, if they learned incorrect info then they will learn the real info, and the good twin will learn the ET.
  While the ET is droisoned, executing the good twin does nothing.

  In SnV where the droisoned ET is rare, and impossible N1, STs will often wake the twins together, and have them make eye contact.
  But on custom scripts where there is a chance of a droisoned ET it is best practice to wake the twins separately.

Q What happens if the good twin in an Evil Twin pair becomes evil? 
A If the Evil Twin is still alive then a new good twin would need to be assigned.

  The twins must always be of opposing alignment,
  so if they are ever the same,
  the good twin has to become someone else.
  The Evil Twin would wake with their new good twin that night to each learn each other.
  The good twin token is moved to the new player and the former twin no longer has anything to do with the Evil Twin.

Q If a new Evil Twin is created (Pit-Hag / Hatter) how is it run?
A Each twin wakes individually to learn who their twin is and their character.
  The good twin does not have to be alive and generally should not be if the Evil Twin is created late game, when the good team would not have enough executions to win.

==========
=Exorcist=
==========
Q Does the Exorcist picking the Demon stop all of their abilities?
A No.  Although the Demon does not wake to attack tonight, any other Demon abilities still work:
  * the Zombuul stays alive if they have fake died once, 
  * the player poisoned by the Pukka the previous night still dies,
  * the Shabaloth can still regurgitate a player.

Q What happens if the Exorcist picks the Lunatic?
A Nothing.  The ST is free to simulate what happens when the actual Demon is picked or they can completely ignore it.

Q Can the Lunatic be told that the Exorcist chose them?
A Yes.  Anything that the Demon could be told based on the characters on the script can be told to the Lunatic to aid with their deception.

  The Lunatic can be told that they were exorcised when the Exorcist:
  * picked them,
  * did not pick them,
  * is not even in play.

  A fake exorcism means that the Demon does not learn of the Lunatic's choice(s), because the Lunatic did not make any. 
  The Demon would not know why this is, as it is indistinguishable from the Lunatic just being drunk or poisoned that night.

  The ST must be cautious: if the Exorcist is in play they might publicly claim who they picked, 
  and if this differs to what the Lunatic was told,
  then this could be detrimental to the evil team.

=========
=Fang Gu=
=========
Q Could the Recluse misregister as a Minion and just die if picked by the Fang Gu?
A Yes.

Q If the Fang Gu picks the Philosopher Outsider, does the Philo become the Fang Gu? 
A No. The Philosopher gains an Outsider ability, but does not become an Outsider.

Q Does the ST wake up the Outsider when the Fang Gu targets them?
A If the Fang Gu kills an Outsider without a jump being possible, the Outsider just dies and does not wake.
  If the Fang Gu jumps, the Outsider is woken and informed of their new alignment and character.

Q Is there anything in the game that can grant another Fang Gu jump?
A No, the Fang Gu jump is a hard once per game, no way around it.

  No amount of Pit-Hag transformations, Barber swaps, Hatter switches or Snake Charmer antics can change this.
  The Fang Gu has a unique reminder token that is placed in the middle of the Grimoire if a jump happens
  and remains there even if the Fang Gu goes out of play and comes back in play.

Q What happens when a Fang Gu is protected (Monk / Innkeeper) and kills an Outsider for first time? 
A The Fang Gu jump is a "package deal" so if they cannot die there is no jump and the Outsider dies.

  The once per game jump is not used up so if the FG later choose another Outsider while both are able to die, a jump can occur.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns himself into an Outsider and the Fang Gu kills him, does the jump happen?
A If it is the first Outsider the Fang Gu has killed, then yes.

Q The Spirit of Ivory with the Bounty Hunter and Fang Gu. The BH adds one evil on setup. What happens if the Fang Gu attacks the first Outsider? A good Fang Gu?
A The Outsider just dies.

Q If the Fang Gu hits the droisoned Recluse does she still jump?
A In that instance, the Fang Gu has to jump, because the Recluse would be unable to register as anything other than the Recluse, an Outsider.

-------combine
Q The Fang Gu is protected (Innkeeper / Monk). They choose to kill the Barber (first Outsider picked).  What happens?
A The jump is blocked so the Barber dies, and the ST offers the Barber swap to the (probably confused) Fang Gu.

Q If the Fang Gu picks the Barber what happens?
A If the Fang Gu has yet to jump this game, and the Fang Gu can die, then the Fang Gu dies and the Barber becomes the evil Fang Gu and there is no Barber swap.

  Otherwise the Barber dies and the Fang Gu can then swap two people's characters.
-----------------


========
=Farmer=
========
Q What happens if the Farmer is the last good player who dies in the night but there is a Marionette and an evil turned Townsfolk who might still pick the Demon,
  so the game cannot be called yet?
A No one becomes a Farmer.

Q If the evil Farmer (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter / ...) dies in the night, who becomes the Farmer?
A It is still an alive good player.

Q If the Farmer dies to the Demon creating a new Farmer but is then resurrected (Professor / Al-Hadikhia / Shabaloth / ...) could there be multiple living Farmers?
A Yes.

Q If the grandchild Farmer is killed, could the Grandmother become a Farmer and not die?
A Yes, because they are now a Farmer and therefore no longer have the Grandmother ability causing them to die.
  If the Grandmother instead dies to her ability then she is no longer a legitimate new Farmer choice.

Q What does a Barista doubled Farmer do?
A The Farmer dying would cause two good living players to become Farmers.

Q What is the Leviathan jinx with the Farmer?
A If the Leviathan is in play and a Farmer dies by execution, a good player becomes a Farmer that night.

Q If the Lycanthrope kills the Farmer and then becomes the Farmer, can there be other deaths that night?
A Yes, as there is no longer a Lycanthrope ability in play preventing deaths.

Q Does the Mathematician get a +1 if a player becomes a Farmer, preventing them from using their previous ability?
A No. As far as the Mathematician is concerned that player is the Farmer and their ability is working fine.

Q Can the Mayor bounce a kill on to the Farmer, triggering the Farmer's ability?
A Yes.  This could even cause the Mayor to become a Farmer.

Q Can the good Goon become a Farmer when the Farmer dies?
A Yes.  The previous Farmer player is not drunked as they are not themselves choosing the Goon with the Farmer ability, the ST is.

Q Does a player waking at night to learn that they are now the Farmer register to the Chambermaid?
A Only if that player woke up due to their ability prior to becoming the Farmer, otherwise no, as changing character is not waking to their ability.

Q Can the Gambler who gambled wrong and died become the Farmer later the same night?
A No, as they are already dead.

Q If a non-Farmer gains the Farmer ability (Cannibal / Philosopher / Pixie / ...) and dies at night, what do they turn another alive good player into?
A They become a Farmer, it does not matter what their actual character was.

Q Suppose, due to the Farmer ability, there are two Farmers in the game and a Washerwoman is created after. 
  Can the Washerwoman be shown both Farmer players as the Farmer?
A Yes.

Q If all good players are Farmers and one is killed by the Demon, is one of the Farmers still woken up and told that they are a Farmer?
A Yes, it is part of the Farmer's ability.

Q When does the Farmer proc at night, right after the kill or at their night order spot? 
A As soon as they are dead.

Q If a multi-kill Demon (Shabaloth / Al-Hadikhia / Po) kills the Farmer as their first pick,
  can their next choices be woken up and told that they are Farmers before their deaths are processed?
A Yes.  Probably best not to though.

============
=Fearmonger=
============
Q Does a successful Fearmonger-execution of an evil Townsfolk or Outsider (Bounty Hunter turned / flipped Cult Leader / flipped Goon / Mezepheles turned / ...)
  or Minion or Demon (Poppygrower game)
  result in a loss for evil.
A Yes. Sometimes the Fearmonger is better off not nominating until they know more about their target.

Q If the Recluse is Fearmonger-executed, who wins?
A The ST can pick a side, but since Fearmonger wins are rare, it should be an evil win.

Q Can the Spy register as good and be Fearmonger-executed, resulting in an evil win?
A Yes but don't.

  The ST can pick which side wins, but it would be harsh on the good team to have the Fearmonger-executed Spy misregister, so it would be best to have evil lose.

Q If a player in a Revolutionary pair is Fearmonger-executed, could they register falsely?
A Yes but don't, as this is then the ST picking the winner.

Q If the Witch cursed Fearmonger nominates and dies but gets their target executed, does their ability still trigger?
A No, they are dead and have no ability.

Q If the Sweetheart is Fearmonger-executed, can they drunk the Fearmonger and prevent their win?
A No.  The Sweetheart's team loses before the drunking happens.

Q If the Fearmonger is successful in executing their target, could the Scapegoat be executed instead, preventing the game from ending?
A Yes, but the ST should not do this as presumably the evil team worked hard to get the Fearmonger target executed and deserve the win!

Q If a player targeted and nominated by the Fearmonger survives the vote but is the same day executed for a madness break or nominating the Virgin,
  is the Fearmonger's win condition triggered?
A No, their choice needs to be executed as a result of the Fearmonger’s nomination.

Q Can the Fearmonger win trigger if the Bishop is in play?
A No.

  The Fearmonger is completely neutralised since they cannot nominate in order to satisfy their ability.  This combination of characters is best avoided.

Q Who wins when the Alchemist Fearmonger chooses and successfully executes the public Goblin?
A Good wins.

  If both the Goblin's and the Fearmonger's abilities are satisfied
  causing both a good and evil win,
  then the result is a good win as good wins on ties.

Q What happens if the Fearmonger chooses herself, then nominates herself and is executed? 
A The Fearmonger's team loses.

Q If the Fearmonger nominates and executes the Lleech host which team will win?
A Evil wins.

  The Fearmonger ability trumps the executing the Demon win condition,
  as ability wins, usually, trump normal game wins.

  Usually, because exceptions are made in rulings if, for example, good could never win otherwise.

Q If the Fearmonger ability enters mid game (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Plague Doctor) how is it run?
A If a player gains the Fearmonger ability, any choices they made as their previous character are not relevant to the Fearmonger announcement;
  their first pick will cause an announcement regardless of who it is. 


=========
=Fiddler=
=========
Q Does the Fiddler override the Evil Twin's "good cannot win" ability?
A Yes, the Fiddler overrides everything.

Q If the Fiddler is in play, can the Demon choose the Spy?
A No.

Q If there is a circle where the Demon does not kill and the town does not nominate, what happens?
A The ST can use the Fiddler, a Fabled character.
  At night, the ST wakes the Demon who must choose one good player.
  The next day, the town votes between the two on who should win. Everyone can vote, it uses no ghost votes, abilities cannot affect this vote, etc.

===========
=Fisherman=
===========
Q Does Fisherman advice have to be specific and can it be affected by the Vortox and misregistration?
A The Fisherman gets whatever the ST wants to give them which can be as specific or vague as they want.
  Misregistration can affect it if the ST wants, and the Vortox must affect it.

============
=Flowergirl=
============
Q If the Flowergirl is dead during the day and resurrected the next night (Al-Hadikhia / Professor / ...),
  are they told if the Demon voted the previous day?
A Yes.

======
=Fool=
======
Q Does the Tea Lady protected Fool get spent when attacked?
A No, any protection ability lets the Fool keep their ability.

Q Can the Pit-Hag's deaths are arbitrary ability kill the unspent Fool / Zombuul?
A Yes.  Effectively they were targeted twice so it appears that they were one-shot.

Q Does a dead player turned into the Fool come back to life as the once killed Fool?
A No, they stay dead.

================
=Fortune Teller=
================
Q The Fortune Teller's Red Herring is any good player.  What happens if that player is turned evil (Mezepheles / ...)?
A The ST moves the RH token to a good player.

Q The Fortune Teller's Red Herring is any good player.  What happens if that player is turned into a Minion or a Demon?
A Nothing, as character type is unimportant.  
  The RH must be a good player, so as long as that player remains good, the RH token stays put.  

Q If the Fortune Teller checks an Imp who just starpassed and they are not a Red Herring will they show up as a Demon ?
A Yes. Starpassing does not change the Imp’s character, just makes them dead and creates a new Imp.
  The FT just checks if any of the two players is a Demon, or registering as one, and a dead Imp is still a Demon.
  Some abilities specify 'the' Demon, which refers to the actual Demon, and these abilities target any alive Demons first,
  or players registering as one, and only if no Demon is alive do they target dead Demons.

Q If the drunked or poisoned Fortune Teller picks their Red Herring, do they have to get a yes? 
A If the FT is poisoned, they can get either yes or no, regardless of who is picked,
  unless it is a Vortox game.

Q Does the Barista 1 Fortune Teller receiving a 'no' on their Red Herring ping the Mathematician?
A Yes, their ability worked abnormally.


=========
=Gambler=
=========
Q Does the Gambler die immediately at the time of the gamble or at the end of the night?
A They die at their turn in the night order.  Generally deaths are immediate, just only announced at dawn, assuming they are still dead then.

Q Can the Gambler die from gambling the Recluse as the Recluse?
A Yes.

==========
=Gangster=
==========
Q The Deviant was funny today so cannot be exiled, but can the Gangster still kill them?
A Yes.

Q Can the Gangster kill the Lleech?
A No.

Q If the unspent Fool is attacked by the Gangster, are they safe?
A Yes, and their ability is used.

Q What happens if the Gangster is holding Lil’ Monsta and kills the grandchild with their ability during the day?
A The Grandmother dies immediately too.

Q What happens if the Gangster is holding Lil’ Monsta and kills the King with their ability during the day?
A The Choirboy learns the Gangster is the Demon that night.

Q What happens if the Gangster is holding Lil’ Monsta and kills the Sage with their ability during the day?
A The Sage learns two players including the Gangster that night.

Q Can the Gangster kill a Tea Lady protected player?
A No.

Q Is the sober Sailor safe from the Gangster?
A Yes.

Q What happens if the Gangster is holding Lil’ Monsta and picks the Soldier with their ability?
A The Soldier does not die.

Q Can the Gangster kill their neighbour who is favoured by the Storm Catcher?
A No.

Q Can the Gangster trigger the Virgin's ability?
A No, the Gangster's choice is not a nomination.

Q Does the Witch-cursed Gangster die if they use their ability?
A No, the Gangster's choice is not a nomination.

Q Can the Scapegoat die instead of the Gangster's target?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q Do Gangster kills prevent the Vortox's win condition?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q Are Gangster kills included in the Leviathan's execution count?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q If the Gangster kills the Demon in a Mastermind game, does the game continue?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution, so the Mastermind's ability is not triggered and the good team wins.

Q If the Goblin publicly claims to be the Goblin and is then Gangster killed, do evil win?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution. 

Q If the Gangster kills the Evil Twin's good twin, do evil win?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution, and the good twin must be executed to trigger evil's win condition.

Q Can the Devil's Advocate prevent the Gangster's kill?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q If the Gangster kills the Saint, do evil win?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution, and the Saint must die by execution to trigger evil's win condition.

Q If the Gangster kills a Minion, does that trigger the Minstrel?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution, and the Minion needs to have died by execution to trigger the Minstrel's ability.

Q Can the Cannibal gain the ability of the Gangster's kill?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q Can the Pacifist prevent the Gangster's kill?
A No, the Gangster's kill is not an execution.

Q Can the Undertaker see who the Gangster killed?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q Is a Gangster kill an execution?
A No, a Gangster kill is not an execution. 

========
=Goblin=
========
Q If the public Goblin is executed while protected by the Devil's Advocate, does their team still win?
A Yes, the Goblin does not need to die as a result of the execution to trigger their win condition. 

Q If the public Vigormortis-killed Goblin is executed, does their team win?
A Yes, they still have their ability through the Vigormortis and the Goblin ability does not require the Goblin to die from the execution.


===========
=Godfather=
===========
Q If there are no Outsiders, what does the Godfather learn?
A The ST wakes them and shakes their head to indicate a no.  A zero would also work but that's not RAW.

Q In a base zero Outsider game, can the Godfather's Outsider modifier by -1?
A Yes, just as the Vigormortis's modifier is -1 in a base zero Outsider game.

Q Can the Spy register as an Outsider to the Godfather? 
A Yes.
  Doing this during setup would be an Outsider ability hurting evil so not recommended.
  But the ST might want to do this after the Spy is executed to give the evil team an extra Godfather kill.

Q Can the Recluse register as the Spy who registers as an Outsider to the Godfather?
A The Recluse who does not misregister as another role would ping the Godfather.
  If the Recluse registered as the Spy then she would not show up to the Godfather, which would be an Outsider ability hurting evil, so usually not recommended.

Q The Godfather and the Recluse are in play. Must the ST show the Recluse token to the Godfather or can she skip them due to their ability to register as a Minion/Demon?
A The ST could do that, but STs should generally not use Outsiders to hinder evil, at least not during N1.

  The GF could probably figure out that that means the Recluse is in play, unless there is other Outsider manipulation in play,
  or they might suspect that they are poisoned, perhaps accidentally by the Poisoner in a Poppy Grower game, so mistrust their info.

Q If the Pit-Hag creates Outsiders that the Godfather did not see at the start,
  does the Godfather get to kill, if one of the new Outsiders dies?
A The Godfather gets to kill if any Outsider died, even one that did not exist at the start of the game.

Q If an Outsider is executed and the following night the Godfather is either resurrected (Al-Hadikhia) or created (Pit-Hag / Hatter)
  do they get a kill?
A Yes, the Godfather is backward-looking so can potentially get a kill.  They should be woken at their turn in the night order for their choice.

Q Does the Hatter's death leading to a mid game Godfather give the new Godfather a kill that same night?
A Yes.  

Q Does a Godfather created mid game (Pit-Hag / Hatter) learn the in play Outsiders?
A Yes.  Wake her up, inform her of her new character and the in play Outsiders regardless of their living status, then put her back to sleep.

=======
=Golem=
=======
Q Can the Pacifist protect the Golem's nominee?
A No, the Golem's nominee is not dying as a result of an execution.

Q Can the Devil's Advocate protect the Golem's nominee?
A No, the Golem's nominee is not dying as a result of an execution.

Q Can the Recluse registering as the Demon survive the Golem's nomination.
A Yes.

Q Could an evil player bluffing as the Golem nominate the Tinker cause them to die?
A Yes, successfully simulating the Golem.

Q Does Barista doubling the Golem have any effect?
A The Golem is still limited to only nominating once per game, 
  but when they nominate, that player dies twice.
  So the Barista-doubled Golem could kill an unused Fool completely in one nomination.

  If the Golem has already used their one nomination, the Barista has no effect on them.

Q Can the unspent Fool survive the Golem's nomination?
A Yes, and their ability is used.

Q If the Tea Lady's neighbours are both good do they survive the Golem's nomination?
A Yes.

Q If the Golem nominates the player favoured by the Storm Catcher, do they die?
A No, they can only die by execution, and a Golem nomination is not an execution.

Q Can the Golem kill the sober Sailor by nominating them?
A No.

Q If the Golem nominates and kills a player, then the Pit-Hag changes them from the Golem and then back to the Golem, do they get to nominate again?
A Yes, as it is a new instance of the ability.

Q Can a player that has previously nominated and becomes the Golem, nominate?
A Yes.

Q Can the Golem kill the Vizier?
A No. The Vizier's ability states that they cannot die during the day.

Q Can the poisoned Golem nominate again?
A No, this is cheating.

Q The Golem nominates the unproced Virgin. Who is executed?  Both are sober/healthy and the Virgin has their ability.
A The Golem is an Outsider so does not proc the Virgin. The Virgin dies to the Golem's nomination because they are not the Demon.
  This is not an execution though, as the Golem's ability just causes a death.
  If it were instead a Philosopher Golem or a Cannibal Golem, the ST could let both abilities resolve.

Q Does the Witch-cursed Golem still get to kill?
A If the Golem is cursed by the Witch, is sober and healthy and nominates a non-Demon, both players would die immediately.
  This includes if the Witch is nominated.

Q If the Devil's Advocate protects someone who is not the Demon, and the Golem nominates them, do they die?
A Yes. The Devil's Advocate protects against death by execution, but the Golem's nomination kills someone but it is not an execution, so there will be no protection there.

Q Can the Golem trigger the Goon's ability?
A No.

  The Golem is not selecting the Goon at night, so is not drunked.
  They simply kill the Goon who dies with whatever alignment they are at the time.




======
=Goon=
======
Q The Goon specifies that a player has to choose them in order for their ability to trigger,
  but if the ST picks them (Lil' Monsta kill / Legion kill / Gossip kill / Mayor bounce / Ojo picks an out of play character / ...),
  can they be flipped or drunk anyone?
A The Goon just dies, drunking no one and no possible alignment changes.
  
  The Goon ability is triggered only by the first player to pick them at night,
  and since the ST is not a player the ability is untriggered and the kill processes normally.

Q If the King learns the Goon, could they trigger the Goon's ability?
A No, as the King is not actively choosing the Goon with their ability.

Q If the unpicked Goon is targeted by an evil player but cannot flip,
  because the Spirit of Ivory is in play and there is already one extra evil player,
  do they still drunk the chooser?
A Yes.

Q Does the Ojo choosing the unpicked Goon cause no deaths?
A Yes, additionally the Ojo is drunked and the Goon flipped / remains evil.
  This is consistent with other characters choosing the Goon (Philosopher / Courtier / ...)

Q If the charged Po happens to select the Goon as the third kill and the Goon has not been selected yet and causes the Po to become drunk,
  do the first two kills happen or would they fail because the Po becomes drunk before dawn? 
A They happen. Except for the Al-Hadikhia, which has different mechanics to other Demons, players die the moment a Demon chooses them.

Q What happens when a multi-kill Demon (Shabaloth / charged Po / Al-Hadikhia / ...) targets the unpicked Goon?
A Kills always happen in the order that they were picked.
  So, except for the Al-Hadikhia which has different mechanics, the previous targets, if unprotected, will die.

Q Can a drunk or poisoned player or the Marionette, the Drunk or the Lunatic flip the Goon?
A Yes. The player is still choosing, which is what the Goon cares about, not whether that choosing would actually do anything.
  The alignment change comes from the Goon's ability, so the Goon is the only player that needs to be healthy and sober for it to happen.

  Remember that the Marionette would flip the Goon evil and the Lunatic would flip them good, which is opposite to what these characters believe should happen.

Q If the Goon dies to the Boomdandy, are they turned evil?
A No, nor do they cause any drunking, as the Boomdandy is not choosing the Goon with their ability.

Q The Innkeeper picks player X and the unpicked Goon, becoming Goon drunk.
  That night the Shabaloth picks the Goon and then player X in that order.
  Does player X die?
A Yes.

  The moment the Innkeeper chose the Goon, they were drunked, and no protection was placed - the ST does not place their reminder tokens in the grim.
  When the Goon dies first, the Innkeeper sobers - the ST removes the Goon drunk reminder token.
  But noone is protected tonight - the Innkeeper tokens were never placed in the grim.

Q Can a Minion guessing the Goon is the Damsel, flip the Goon's alignment?
A No, the Minion is not choosing the Goon with their ability.

Q If the Pit-Hag selects the Goon and tries to turn them into a role that is already in play, what happens?
A If the PH is the first player to target the Goon that night, then the PH is drunked and the Goon turns/stays evil.
  Whether the chosen role would have worked does not matter, the Goon’s ability is about a player choosing them not whether the choice has an effect.

Q Is the Goon awakened to learn they switch alignment?
A Yes, every time.
  When the Goon changes alignment, they wake straight after the player who triggers them to learn this. Note, that this also registers to the Chambermaid.

Q Does the drunk or poisoned evil Goon stay evil?
A Yes.

--
Q If the Pukka selects the Goon first, is the Goon still poisoned and dies after the Pukka becomes sober?
A No, in this instance the Goon will turn evil, the Pukka-poison is not applied and the Pukka is Goon-drunk. 
  No one will die to the Pukka this night, and the previously poisoned player is temporarily unpoisoned from the Pukka.
  When the Pukka becomes sober and healthy (next night probably), 
  the player who was poisoned prior to choosing the Goon will be poisoned again and die later that night after the Pukka chooses a new target 
  (so long as that new target is not the unchosen Goon again!).

Q How does the whole interaction between the Pukka and the Goon work?
A If the Goon has been picked already that night -> Goon becomes poisoned, and dies next night
  If the Goon has not been picked yet -> Pukka becomes drunk, Goon becomes evil, no one dies tonight to the Demon.
  previously Pukka poisoned player is temporarily unpoisoned for as long as the Pukka has lost their ability 
  When the Pukka regains their ability, the previously Pukka poisoned player dies after the Pukka picks again.
--

Q If the Assassin picks the Goon first, the Goon dies, but do they also become evil?
A Yes, the Goon dies and becomes evil.

Q If the player selecting the Goon to die is made sober and healthy by the Barista, does the Goon still change alignment, or does the death override this?
A Yes, the Goon changes alignment irrespective of whether they manage to drunk the responsible player.

Q What happens when the Widow poisons the Goon? 
A If the Widow chooses the Goon, the Widow is drunk and the Goon turns evil but remains healthy so can be turned good again on future nights.
  No one is told that the Widow is in play on N1.
  On N2, when the Widow is now sober, a good player is told the Widow is in play, but the Widow has no ongoing poison.

Q If the Gambler gambles the Goon, does this make the Gambler drunk and the Goon turn good, or does the Gambler ability not trigger the Goon's ability?
A If the Gambler picks the player with the Goon ability (what they gamble them as is not relevant),
  the Gambler is drunked, and the Goon, if the Gambler was the first to pick them that night, is turned good.
  If the Gambler gambles another player as the Goon, the Goon would have no effect on the Gambler.

Q If the Poisoner targets the Goon and the Pit-Hag changes the Goon into a demon
  is the result an evil demon or a good demon?
A If the Poisoner was the first person to target the Goon at night, the Goon turns evil, the Poisoner is Goon-drunk and the Goon is unpoisoned.
  If the Pit-Hag hits the Goon afterwards, the Goon just changes character, not alignment.
  So they would be an evil demon and the Poisoner is no longer Goon-drunk.

Q What happens if the Lleech picks the unpicked Goon as their host?
A The Lleech is Goon drunk and the Goon turns evil, but is still the host.
  Being drunked the Lleech fails to poison the Goon,
  so the Goon’s ability then continues to function normally throughout the game, despite being the host.

Q What happens if the Barber dies and the Demon chooses two players, one of whom is the good Goon?
A The Barber swap happens normally with no alignment flipping or drunking.

  The Goon's ability is unactivated; it reads "the first player to choose you with _their_ ability",
  and the Demon player is picking them with the Barber's ability.

Q The Courtier targets the Goon.  What happens?
A If the Courtier is the first to pick the Goon that night, then the Goon turns good and the Courtier is drunk.
﻿
Q If the Philosopher chooses the Goon ability, and there is an actual Goon in play, what happens?
A The Goon drunks the Philo, becomes their alignment, and then the Philo is left with no ability.

Q In the almanac for Goon it says if the Courtier chooses the character Goon, they become Goon drunk,
  and turn the Goon good if they are the first person interacting with the Goon.
  The text for Courtier is "choose a character". Now the text for Cerenovus is "choose a player and a character".
  So rules as written, if the Cerenovus attempts to make a player mad as the Goon,
  the Goon character is chosen and the Cerenovus would be made Goon drunk and turn the Goon evil, correct?
A No. The Courtier is targeting a player by way of choosing a character - only the player with that character token could possibly become Courtier drunk.
  (it is kind of like even though they are not pointing at the Goon player, their ability still is)

  The Cerenovus is not choosing the Goon in the same sense. They are not interacting with the Goon player just by pointing at Goon on the character list.

Q Can the Goon drunk the Balloonist?
A No. The Goon is not chosen by the Balloonist, merely shown to the Balloonist, so does not make the Balloonist drunk and is a valid player for the ST to show.

Q Can the Goon drunk the Mezepheles? 
A No, the Mez is not targeting any one player/role specifically.

Q Can the Goon drunk the Gossip?
A No.  Gossip kills are chosen by the ST not a player,
  so if the Gossip makes a true statement and the ST kills off the Goon with the Gossip ability,
  no part of the Goon's ability is triggered (drunking or alignment flipping), the Goon just dies.

Q If the Bounty Hunter learns the Goon as evil, can the Goon's ability trigger?
A No. The BH being shown the Goon is not choosing the Goon with their ability, so they cannot be made drunk or flip the Goon.


Q What happens if the Fang Gu picks the Goon?
A If they are the first to pick the Goon that night, the Goon becomes evil and the Fang Gu becomes drunk. 
  If someone already picked the Goon, and the Fang Gu has yet to jump this game, the Goon becomes the evil Fang Gu and the current Fang Gu dies.
  if someone already picked the Goon and there has already been a Fang Gu jump, then the Goon just dies.

Q If the Po picks the Pacifist, the Goon and the Minstrel in that order, would only the Pacifist die, since the Goon makes the Po drunk saving themselves and the Minstrel?
  Or would all of them survive because of the Goon?
A If the Goon has not been picked yet in that night, only the Pacifist dies.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns a good player into the Goon, do they become evil?
A No, because the Goon was out of play at the time of the pick so was not targeted.
  So they would stay good, at least until another evil player chooses them first in the night. 
  And that does include if a different evil player chooses the new Goon that same night, before any good players do.


========
=Gossip=
========
Q The Gossip gossips that someone is the Demon.  The following night that player becomes the Demon (Pit-Hag / Barber / Engineer / Hatter / Fang Gu / ...).
  Is there a gossip kill?
A No, the gossip is either true or not at the time the statement is made.

Q Is the Gossip allowed to make a compound gossip, i.e. "I gossip X or Y."?
A Yes.  The ST might prompt the player to specify if they intend it to be an exclusive or, i.e. exactly one thing is true.

Q If the dead Gossip made a true gossip during the day, then is resurrected (Al-Hadikhia / Professor), will there be a Gossip kill?
A Yes.

Q If a non-Gossip during the day makes a correct gossip and then that night becomes the Gossip 
  (Pixie / Philosopher / Cannibal / Pit-Hag / Barber / ...)
  does the new Gossip kill at their turn in the night order?
A Yes.  It is recommended that the ST tracks any player's gossips who could potentially become the Gossip.

Q If the Gossip makes a correct gossip during the day
  but that night is swapped to a different role (Pit-Hag / Barber swap / turned into the Farmer / ...)
  is there a Gossip kill that night?
A No.

Q Could the Gossip making a correct gossip kill the Farmer, triggering the Farmer's ability?
A Yes.  The Gossip could even become the Farmer themselves.

Q Can the Gossip's kill target a player that cannot die, either because they are protected by an ability or are already dead?
A Yes, but this is not recommended since the idea is that the extra kill tells the Gossip something.

Q Can "there are two Demons" be a correct Gossip statement when the Recluse is in play?
A Yes, if the Recluse is registering as a Demon for it.

Q How is the Gossip affected by drunking and poisoning?
A The Gossip is a backwards-checking ability.
  During the previous day, even if they were drunk or poisoned, if the Gossip made a correct statement, the ST would have placed the Gossip's dead reminder in the grim.
  Then that night, as long as they are sober, healthy and alive, the Gossip kill goes through.

=============
=Grandmother=
=============
Q Can the Spy registering as good be seen by the Grandmother?
A Yes.

Q Can the grandchild be a Townsfolk / Outsider turned evil (Mezepheles / Cult Leader / Goon / Bounty Hunter / ...)?
A At the start of the game the Grandmother must be shown a good player.
  As the Grandmother is a 'you start knowing' character, not a 'you know' character,
  if their grandchild subsequently turns evil, she does not get a new grandchild and still dies if he is killed by the Demon.
  
  A Grandmother created mid game cannot be shown the player turned evil.

Q If the Grandmother is created late into the game, can their grandchild be a dead player?
A Yes.

  The only restriction on the grandchild is that they are a good player.
  Showing a dead good player is allowed and doing so protects the Grandmother from being able to trigger their own death.

Q Does the Grandmother learn if their grandchild changes (Damsel / Pixie / Pit-Hag / Barber /  ...) character?
A No.  The Grandmother only "starts knowing" their character, not "knows" throughout the game.

Q If the grandchild dies when the Grandmother is protected, drunk or poisoned,
  what happens the next night when the grandchild is still dead and Gran is no longer protected/droisoned?
A They remain alive.

Q The Demon kills the grandchild at night while the Monk protects the Grandmother.
  Does the Grandmother die, or is she safe enough from the demon?
A The Grandmother dies. They die to their own ability, not the Demon's.
  Now if Grandmother was Innkeeper protected, they would be safe.

Q If the Demon picks the grandchild Gambler who has died to their own gamble, does the Grandmother survive?
A Yes. The Demon must kill the Grandchild in order for the Grandmother to attack themselves. In this case, the Gambler is dead and cannot be killed again.

Q Could the drunk or poisoned Grandmother learn on their first night a player's correct role, but their grandchild be another player?
A Yes.

Q What happens if the Grandmother is poisoned on N1?
A The ST still marks a good player as the grandchild and can then show a different player to the poisoned Grandmother.
  If the real grandchild dies to the Demon then the Grandmother, as long as she is not droisoned, will die regardless of if that is who she saw.

Q Can the Grandmother learn as their grandchild the Townsfolk turned evil by the Bounty Hunter?
A No, the Grandmother's ability is that they start knowing a _good_ player.

============
=Gunslinger=
============
Q The Gunslinger may kill anyone that voted during the first vote of the day, but what if no player voted?
A Then they cannot kill anyone.

  A tally of zero votes during the first vote still means that there was a vote,
  so the Gunslinger does not get to wait to another vote where votes are actually cast.

Q If a vote to exile the Gunslinger does not succeed, can the Gunslinger use their power? 
A No, supporting an exile is not a vote, and calling for exile is not a nomination.

Q Can the Gunslinger kill the Lleech?
A No.

========
=Harlot=
========
Q Can the Lleech die if they reveal to the Harlot?
A No.

Q If the Mayor agrees to be seen by the Harlot, could the ST kill the Harlot and use the Mayor bounce to kill another character?
A Yes.

=======
=Harpy=
=======
Q When do Harpy targets die?
A At any point during the day or night until the Harpy picks again.  

Q Do deaths caused by the Harpy count as executions?
A No, the text says "dead", not "executed", so the day continues, unlike deaths caused by the Cerenovus.

========
=Hatter=
========
Q When the Hatter is triggered, is there any standard to who should be prompted to choose first after waking the evil team together, or is it random?
A No, the order is whatever the ST decides. 

  Living evils should probably choose before dead.
  As the evils wake together the ST could allow whoever wants to change first to do so.

Q If the Recluse misregisters, can they change character when the Hatter dies?
A Yes, but don't as this is unlikely to be fun.

Q If the Hatter dies does can the evil Apprentice change their Minion ability?
A No, they are not a Minion so unaffected by the Hatter.

Q If the Hatter dies does can an evil Townsfolk (Bounty Hunter / Mezepheles / Cult Leader) or the evil Goon choose a new character?
A No, only Minions and Demons are affected by the Hatter.

Q Does a Minion or a Demon waking to make a choice after the Hatter dies register to the Chambermaid?
A No, it is not their own ability causing them to wake.

Q If the Hatter dies and the Minions change characters, can they have a new Damsel guess?
A No.

Q If the Hatter dies and a Minion or the Demon is drunk / poisoned, do they still change character?
A Yes, they become the drunk / poisoned role that they chose, as the change is due to the Hatter's ability, not their own.

Q How is the Hatter ability run? / When does the Hatter ability activate?
A The Hatter ability is immediate, similar to the Barber:
  * If the Hatter dies during the day, they use their ability before any other character.
  * If the Hatter dies at night, they use their ability immediately. The night order is only a reminder.

  Each Minion and Demon chooses their role, one after the other, knowing the previous choices.

Q What happens if the Hatter dies in a Legion game?
A Nothing, as per the jinx.

Q What happens if the Hatter dies in a non Legion game and an evil player picks Legion?
A All evil players become Legion, as per the jinx.

Q If Lil' Monsta kills the Hatter (and the variant rule is not being used),
  does the babysitting Minion choose from the Minions list, the Demons list, or either list?
A The babysitter chooses a different Demon to become or they can opt to remain as Lil' Monsta by picking a Minion.

Q What is the Hatter jinx with Lil' Monsta?
A If the Demon chooses Lil' Monsta then they also choose a Minion to become and babysit Lil' Monsta tonight.

Q Does a good Minion or Demon wake due to the Hatter dying?
A Yes.

Q How does the Hatter and Poppy Grower interact?
A The ST should probably wake the affected players separately.

Q If the Hatter dies on or after day five, can the Demon choose to become the Leviathan, instantly winning the game?
A No, as per the jinx.

=========
=Heretic=
=========
Q Can the ST be executed on a script with the Atheist to win via the Heretic?
A No.

Q Why does the Baron have a possible +1 to Outsiders when the Heretic is on the script?
A Because otherwise in a base two Outsiders game with the Baron and only four Outsiders on the script,
  the evil team can know for sure that the Heretic is in play,
  and then the Demon can kill themselves and win.

Q The Fearmonger executes the good Lleech host in a Heretic game. Who wins?
A Good wins.

  Abilities trump normal win conditions.  
  So although the Demon died (good win) the Fearmonger win condition takes precedence (evil win), then the Heretic flips this to a good win.

Q In a final three of the Heretic, the Demon, and the Poisoner who is poisoning the Heretic, if the Poisoner is executed, does good win?
A Yes. The Poisoner being executed means the Heretic is no longer poisoned, and since the evil win condition is satisfied in a Heretic game, good wins.

Q The evil twinned Saint and the Heretic are in play. The Saint gets executed. Who wins?
A The Heretic applies last, so the Saint being executed (assuming they are the good Saint) would cause evil to win,
  then the Heretic flips it to a good win, unaffected by the Evil Twin. 
  This means that evil cannot win in a Heretic game so long as the twins are both alive.

Q Why are the Godfather and the Heretic jinxed?
A The Godfather knows which Outsiders are in play.
  If they learnt that the Heretic is in play, they could tell the Demon to kill themselves, resulting in a free win for evil.

Q As per the jinx, the Godfather in play means there can be no Heretic in play.  Does this also apply to the Alchemist Godfather?
A Yes.  Jinxes apply to abilities not characters so an Alchemist Godfather means the Heretic must be out of play.

Q If the Heretic is drunk or poisoned what happens?
A If the Heretic, regardless of living status, is drunk or poisoned when the game ends,
  then her ability does not function so the win conditions are not reversed.

Q What happens if there are two Heretic abilites in play, due to the Cannibal or the Philosopher?
A Two sober and healthy Heretic abilities would cancel each other out, making win conditions normal again.

Q Does an alive Philosopher Heretic drunking the actual Heretic cause win conditions to be flipped?
A Yes.  But should the Philosopher die, both Heretic abilities would then function, cancelling each other out.

Q Does the Cannibal or the Philosopher with an "even while dead" ability, such as the Heretic's, keep that ability when they die?
A Yes, they lose the Cannibal/Philosopher ability but keep any "even while dead" ability.

Q Does the good wins ties rule apply before or after the Heretic's ability?
A The Heretic flips the winning team after the game has ended.
  So if two win conditions are satisfied at once,
  good wins on ties,
  which is then flipped by the Heretic causing evil to win.

  For example, in a final three of the Heretic, the Vortox and the Mayor the day ends without execution results in an evil win:
  No execution with three alive with both Vortox and Mayor in play means a good character win condition competing with an evil character win condition, so good wins.
  The Heretic ability is then applied, so evil wins.

Q If the Demon killed themselves in a Heretic game but the Heretic became drunk afterwards (but in the same night), would that be a good win?
A No. The game would end instantly as the Demon dies; nothing would happen later in the night.
  The Heretic would have to be drunk or poisoned before the Demon dies.


================
=High Priestess=
================
Q Can you show the High Priestess themselves?
A Yes.

Q Can the High Priestess only receive living players?
A No, you show them dead players too.

Q Who does the drunk / poisoned High Priestess see?
A Anyone.

Q Who does the High Priestess see in a Vortox game?
A The only restriction is that the ST does not give the one player that they would have given if it was not a Vortox game.
  It does not have to be the least helpful player to talk to.

==========
=Huntsman=
==========
Q Can the Pixie see the Huntsman?
A Yes.  This would confirm to the Pixie that both the Huntsman and the Damsel are in play.

Q Does the Huntsman actually change the outsider count? Or does it turn an already existing outsider into the Damsel?
A ST choice.
 
  Adding an Outsider does sound like a terrible Townsfolk ability, but it is a legal move.
  The players will not know for sure if the ST added the Damsel on top of the base Outsider count, but generally the Huntsman does not.
  The decision could depend on how weak or strong the good and evil characters that are in play.
  Players would likely prefer you swap an existing Outsider, as the other option is far too much of a downside for good and essentially removes two Townsfolk for nothing.

Q Could the Huntsman add the Damsel and then the Godfather or the Vigormortis remove it?
A No, the end result is an illegal setup.

Q In a base two Outsiders game, if both the Godfather and the Huntsman are in play,
  does the Huntsman modify the base two outsiders or can the Damsel be the +1 outsider added by the Godfather?
A With the Huntsman's ability, the ST:
   either changes a Townsfolk into the Damsel (so +1 Outsider), 
   or changes instead an existing Outsider into the Damsel (no change in the Outsider count).
  Note however that the Huntsman cannot add a second Damsel while there is already one in play.

  In a Huntsman Godfather game, the Outsider count could be anywhere between one and four in a base two Outsider game:
   1 Outsider: The Damsel. The Godfather removed an Outsider
   2 Outsiders: The Godfather removed an Outsider and the Huntsman changed a Townsfolk into the Damsel.
   3 Outsiders: The Damsel is already in play and the Godfather added an Outsider.
   4 Outsiders: Godfather added an Outsider and the Huntsman changed a Townsfolk into the Damsel.
  Probably some of them are unbalanced, but all of there are technically allowed.





=====
=Imp=
=====
Q The Monk protected player is safe from the Demon.  Does this mean a Monk protected Minion cannot become the Demon if the Imp self-kills?
A Safe means harmful effects like death, poison, or turning evil.
  Changing characters, including becoming the Demon, is not a harmful effect so the Imp can successfully pass to a Minion even when Monk protected.

  If the Monk protects the Imp about to self-kill however then the jump is blocked.

Q If the Imp self-kills, do they remain an Imp for character checkers (Fortune Teller / Ravenkeeper / Dreamer / ...)?
A Yes.

Q When an Imp self-kills, and there are several Minions alive, is there a priority order for who should become the new Demon?
A The Scarlet Woman must become the Demon if their ability is active (alive, not drunk or poisoned, 5+ alive players), as that is the entire point of their ability.
  Otherwise, it is the ST's choice which living Minion becomes the Imp from the Imp's ability. 

Q When an Imp self-kills turning a Minion into a new Imp, are the entire evil team notified about the identity of the new Demon? 
A No, only the new Imp.  The other evils are not notified, but they will know that it happened since their Demon died.

Q If an Imp self-kills do they get to choose which Minion becomes the new Imp assuming there is no Scarlet Woman?
A No, that is the ST's choice.
  The evil team can of course inform the ST of a plan they have involving the starpass landing on a specific Minion,
  and the ST may choose to aid that plan, but the ST is not obligated to do so.
 
Q If the Imp kills the Mayor, can the ST use the Mayor to bounce the kill back to the Imp, forcing the starpass?
A Yes.

Q Can multiple Imps self-kill in one game? / Can the Imp change more than once in the same game?
A Yes, it is part of the Imp's ability and is not a once per game action like the Fang Gu jump.
  
  The physical game comes with four Imp tokens, since (not including Recluse hijinks) that is how many Imps there could end up being.


===========
=Innkeeper=
===========
Q The Shabaloth picks the Innkeeper first, then one of the Innkeeper's picks second.
  Who dies and how is the Innkeeper drunking affected?
A The order of the Shab's choices matters and characters die, if they can, as they are chosen.
  So the Innkeeper dies the moment they are chosen and any protection and drunking they are the source of leaves the Grimoire immediately.

Q If the unpicked Goon is targeted last by a multi-kill Demon (charged Po / Shabaloth), the Demon's previous picks still die.
  However, if the Innkeeper chooses to protect the unpicked Goon second, their first pick is unprotected.  Why?
A The difference between a multi-kill Demon and the Innkeeper is that kills are instant and are not retroactively undone if the Demon loses their ability,
  while the Innkeeper needs their ability to protect players.

==============
=Investigator=
==============
Q Can the Spy in a single Minion game misregister to the Investigator,
  giving them a 'no' or a '0'?
A Yes, it is a legal move, if not necessarily a fun one.

Q Can the Investigator see the Recluse as a certain Minion?
A Yes, and this is a common occurrence.

Q Can the Librarian or Investigator ping on themselves? Such as when seeing a Drunk or Marionette respectively?
A The Librarian or Investigator player is "a player", so they can see themselves. 
  So it is a legal move, if not necessarily a fun one.

=======
=Judge=
=======

Q Why are the Evil Judge and the Fearmonger a broken combination?
A The Judge can force through whatever nomination the Fearmonger makes even if it gets zero votes.
  For this reason it is no recommended to have the Judge as a Traveller option on a Fearmonger script.

=========
=Juggler=
=========
Q How does a a mid game created Juggler (Philosopher / Cannibal / Damsel / Barber / Pit-Hag / Pixie / ...) work?
A It is the first day with the Juggler ability that a player can juggle.
  So they would juggle the day after they become the Juggler and learn their info the following night.

Q The Juggler can juggle someone as multiple characters but can they juggle a player as the same character multiple times?
A Yes.

  This is a legal tactic to tell their info apart, although not everyone considers it a useful move.
  Using this strategy the Juggler can juggle one person once and and another person twice, using the resulting 0, 1, 2, or 3 to narrow down their info.

Q If the Juggler does not Juggle, do they still get a number?
A This can be ruled either way:
  * Some STs rule that even if they do not claim Juggler they can still get information.
  * Some STs rule that the "public" aspect of Juggler requires an actual claim in Town Square and no claim means no info.

  These are both legitimate rulings, and can make a difference in a Vortox game.  

Q When does the Philosopher Juggler have to juggle to get their info?
A The day after they picked the Juggler ability.  They are then woken the following night to gain their info.

Q When the Juggler gets her info, is it the info at the moment she wakes? Or is it at the time she juggled?
A The info is tied to what was true at the time of the juggle; any role changes since the juggle are ignored.

Q If the Juggler is changed into something else by the Pit-Hag on the night she would have received her number, does she still receive info of her juggles? 
A No.

Q The Bone Collector picks the dead Juggler.  When does the Juggler need to juggle?
A They must juggle during the day, when they are dead and have no ability,
  and then the following night when they are bone collected they get their info.

Q How does a dead Juggler that is resurrected (Professor / Al-Hadikhia / ...) work?
A She gets a completely fresh ability, so can she juggle the following day and get answers that night.

Q How does a Barista 2 Juggler work?
A The ST would have to decide how they would want that to work.

========
=Kazali=
========
Q If the Kazali were made drunk by the Puzzlemaster, would they still be able to make Minions?
A Yes, because the setup brackets occur before start of game effects such as the Puzzlemaster, the Poppygrower etc.
  The same way the Bounty Hunter cannot be made puzzledrunk to not add an extra evil Townsfolk.

Q Does the Demon learn who the Lunatic Kazali chose as their Minions?
A Technically the Lunatic ability requires this, but the ST is free to choose that they do not.

Q What info is there to hide from the Kazali in a game with the Poppy Grower? 
A During Demon info the Kazali is not told who their Minions are, even though they just picked them.
  They do learn their bluffs and any other relevant info to the Demon (Marionette, King, Lunatic).

  The Minions are told their new character and any other relevant information (Damsel) but do not learn the Kazali.
  When running in person games, the ST should put the Kazali to sleep and wake each Minion separately.

  Most of the time it is not that important as the Kazali can just gather the evil team together and get them up to speed,
  though it is more relevant if the Goon or the Soldier are on the script which can disrupt the Kazali's picks.

Q Can the ST give a new Minion’s previous role to the Kazali as a bluff?
A Yes, but that might be considered nerfing the power of the Kazali.

Q When the Kazali picks the Baron, are two extra Outsiders added?
A No, nothing happens.

Q What does the Kazali's [-? or +? Outsiders] setup modifier mean exactly? 
A It works as a wild card so that no matter what Minions the Kazali creates,
  and what number of Outsiders or Townsfolk are replaced, 
  the result will always be a valid setup.

  If the Kazali chose an Outsider, then their setup was [-1 Outsider]. 
  If an extra Outsider was added to the base count but then the Kazali chose none, their setup was [+1 Outsider].
  
  The players have to keep that in mind when the Outsider count is not aligning with what should be in play.

Q What happens when the Kazali picks the Goon to be a Minion?
A As per the jinx, the Goon becomes evil and the Minion the Kazali chose. 
  The Kazali is now drunk for the rest of N1 so any remaining Minion picks are ignored by the ST who decides the rest of the evil team herself.
  During Minion info, when the Kazali is told their true Minions, they will likely guess what happened.

Q As per the jinx the Kazali cannot choose the King to become a Minion if the Choirboy is in play.
  How is this run, since the Demon does not yet know who the King is?
A If the King and Choirboy are both in play and the Kazali happens to randomly choose the King,
  the ST shakes their head no and forces them to choose again.
  If after all of their picks the King still exists, the Kazali is told who the King is.

Q When does the Kazali learn the King?
A After she has picked her Minions.

Q Can the Kazali choose to make the Marionette?
A Yes, she must choose one of her neighbours though.

Q What happens if the Soldier is N1 selected by the Kazali?
A The Soldier does not become a Minion so the Kazali is down one Minion for the game.  She will realise this if she pays attention during the Demon info step.

Q How does the Magician work in a Kazali game?
A The ST should put the Kazali to sleep when waking each Minion to tell them their character has changed,
  then show both the Demon and the Magician during the Minion info step. 

Q Does a Townsfolk player still turn evil if the Kazali turns the Bounty Hunter into a Minion?
A No.  As per the jinx, an evil Townsfolk is only created if the BH remains in play after the Kazali acts.

Q Does waking to learn that you are now a Minion in a Kazali game register to the Chambermaid?
A No, as that is not waking due to their ability, but the Kazali's.

Q What is the Kazali jinx with the Huntsman?
A If the Kazali chooses the Damsel to become a Minion, and the Huntsman is in play, a good player becomes the Damsel.

Q Do the Minions still learn about the Damsel if the Damsel was picked by the Kazali to be a Minion?
A No, they would only learn about the Damsel if they remain unpicked, and after the Kazali has made all her Minion picks.

Q How is the Alchemist affected by the Kazali's picks?
A Once the Kazali has chosen her Minions, the ST will give the Alchemist an out of play Minion ability.

Q Apart from the Goon, is there any other way for the Kazali to be affected by poisoning or drunking characters on N1?
A No, the Kazali acts before all such characters.

Q How is the game affected if the Balloonist is turned into a Minion by the Kazali?
A The Balloonist's setup effect can be duplicated by the Kazali's, so the Balloonist is a valid pick.

======
=King=
======

Q What happens when a new instance of the King is created mid game (Pit-Hag / Barber / Damsel / Philosopher / Cannibal / Pixie / ...)?
A If there are enough dead, the player can get information that night.
  
  Also the Demon learns the player as the King immediately,
  and if she did not learn of a King on N1,
  then she will reason that the Choirboy is out of play,
  and that she can kill the now-King with impunity.

Q Does the Zombuul who is registering as dead count towards the King's "dead outnumber the living" requirement?
A Yes.

Q Does the Demon learn of the Apprentice King?
A Yes.

Q If the King is resurrected (Professor / Shabaloth / Bone Collector) is the Demon told again who the King is?
A Yes.

Q What does the King learn in a Vortox game?
A Characters that are out of play or already dead.

Q Can "the King" for the Choirboy ability refer to any character with the King ability?
A No, the King only. Philosopher King, Drunk King, Marionette King, Cannibal King, Pixie King - none of these would count for the Choirboy ability.

Q Does the Demon learn the Drunk who believes that they are the King?
A No. The Drunk believing that they are the King is not the King.
  On the other hand, the King who N1 is drunk, or poisoned, does not alert the Demon until they are sober / healthy.

Q Does the Demon learn the Marionette who believes that they are the King?
A No. The Marionette believing that they are the King is not the King.

Q Does a newly created Demon learn who the King is?
A Yes. The King's ability, which is a constant check, says "the Demon knows" so new Demons learn who the King is.

Q Does the King include Travellers in the 'dead outnumber the living'?
A Yes. If they were were not, the ability would say so, like Scarlet Woman does.

=======
=Klutz=
=======
Q The Pukka kills the Klutz. Is the Klutz poisoned when they must pick someone the following morning?
A No.

Q The Klutz gets nominated in a Riot game and dies. Do they have to pick someone before (optionally) nominating?
A Yes. Their countdown will restart if the game is continuing. So it would look like this:
  #  ST: <Klutz> dies. 3... 2...
  #  Klutz: I claim Klutz and pick x.
  #  ST: The game continues. 3... 2...

=Knight=
========
Q Can the Knight see Legion?
A No, they must see two non-Legion players as each Legion player is a Demon and cannot be seen by the Knight even when registering as a Minion.

Q Can the Knight see the ST if Atheist is on the script?
A No, the ST is not a player.  However, if the Atheist is in play then the ST breaking the rules can be shown.

Q Can the Knight see the Recluse?
A ST choice; it depends on how the Recluse registers.

========
=Legion=
========
Q Can Legion register as a Minion to the Slayer?
A Yes, but this would be in addition to registering as a Demon, not instead of, so the Legion player will stay die.

  Legion registers as both Legion and an arbitrary Minion at all times,
  with said Minion misregistration only overriding their normal registration if an ability forces a collapse into one state or the other.
  In the case of the Slayer,
  it has no effect since the Slayer ability does not have any exclusive interactions with Minions;
  as such, they still get killed for registering as the Demon.

Q If the Puzzlemaster correctly figures out who is drunk in a Legion game, what do they learn?
A The ST chooses one Legion player to show them.

Q What does the Balloonist see in a Legion game?
A A Townsfolk, an Outsider and two Legions as each Legion also registers as a Minion.

Q Does an evil Townsfolk (turned by Bounty Hunter  / flipped Cult Leader) vote count in a Legion game?
A No.  Votes still need a good player to pass.

Q Does Legion register to the Chambermaid?
A No, Legion players never wake from their own ability.

Q What do character checkers (Dreamer/Juggler/Gambler/Ravenkeeper/Undertaker) see when they pick a Legion player?
A They can see a Minion since Legion registers as a Minion in the same way that the Recluse does.

Q How does the Exorcist interact with Legion?
A When the Exorcist picks a Legion player,
  that player learns the Exorcist,
  but deaths due to Legion are not prevented that night as Legion does not wake.

Q Do Legion learn the King?
A The ST can show as many Legion as she wishes that the King is in play.  At least one Legion player is recommended.

Q Can there be the same number of Legion as there are good players?
A No, that be an illegal setup.  'Most players are Legion' requires Legion to outnumber the good players.

Q What happens if Legion kill the Sage?
A The Sage learns "two players, one of which is the Demon who killed them".
  So the ST can show any Legion player as the one that killed the Sage
  and any other player (including another Legion).
  The only illegal option is to show two non-Legion players

Q If the Recluse and all Legion vote, can the ST count it as zero votes?
A Yes but don't.
  The evil team would not appreciate an Outsider ability being used to expose everyone who voted.

Q In a Legion game, what can the Investigator see?  Can they see a Legion token?
A The Investigator would not see a Legion token, as that is a Demon token.
  They would see the token of a Minion from the script.
  Each Legion can register as a Minion, as well a a Demon, so the Investigator / Undertaker / .. 
  can see a Minion token instead of a Legion,
  which is recommended given that the ST typically wants to help Legion deceive town as to whether Legion is in play. 

Q Legion do not know other Legions, right?
A Legion learn other Demons/Minions like normal.

Q All alive Legion can potentially kill one player, right?
A Yes, though Legion should usually never kill more than two, and if they do multi-kill it should be multiple Legions.
  Multi-kill is usually done to support a world pushed by the Legions so it balances out.
  For example, if a Legion is bluffing Gossip and asks the ST to kill an extra player tonight, the ST will typically comply and kill one more Legion.

Q Does the Juggler juggling a Legion as a Minion always get a 1?
A No, the Legion player can register as a specific Minion that is not the one juggled.

Q Can the Clockmaker get a 0 in a Legion game?
A No, they should get the number between the two closest Legion, which is usually a 1.

Q Do Legions learn each other in a Teensyville game?
A No.

Q Can the drunk Investigator learn of a Legion who is out of play?
A No, the Investigator can never see Legion; Legion registers as a Minion, but the Legion character is not a Minion character.

Q What can the Investigator see in a Legion game?
A They can be shown a Legion and any other player and any Minion token.

Q Can the Fortune Teller receive a yes on any Legion player?
A Yes, plus they still have a Red Herring.

Q Does any Legion player voting in a nomination register to the Flower Girl?
A Yes, regardless of whether the vote tally ends up being zero.

===========
=Leviathan=
===========
Q A Minion is executed on D5 of a Leviathan game. Does the Minstrel activate, allowing for good to win by executing the Leviathan on D6?
A Yes.

  The Leviathan will be drunk until the end of the next day at dusk, so their win condition cannot trigger until they sober up.
  Any execution will happen before this time giving the good team the chance to execute the Leviathan.

Q If the Leviathan becomes drunk or poisoned after the first dusk, are the players told that the Leviathan is in play when they become sober and healthy?
A No, all players already know the Leviathan is in play if they have been already announced it. The extra day notifications are just there for the players to remember the day count.

Q On N1 the Poisoner learns two players as the Demon.  Could she poison one to confirm who is the Leviathan and who is the Magician?
A Yes.

  If the Leviathan is drunk or poisoned then no announcement goes out until they are sober and healthy.
  So, unless the ST runs the Leviathan differently, the Poisoner could use this to confirm the real Demon.

Q If the Leviathan becomes another Demon (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Engineer / ...) does everybody learn that the Leviathan is no longer in play?
A No.
  There is no active ability letting players know the Leviathan’s state,
  so there is no mechanical reason to tell the town the Leviathan is out of play. 
  Some STs will announce the Leviathan is in play every day in which case they would have to stop saying that, but it is not required.

  This is similar to how:
  * the good twin is not informend if the Evil Twin becomes a different character,
  * the Vizier is not announced as no longer being the Vizier when swapped to another character, etc.

Q Can the Leviathan kill at night?
A No, that is not part of their ability.

Q The Pit-Hag creates a Leviathan and the ST kills the old Leviathan.
  If a good player has already been executed, would executing the good Leviathan lose the game for the good team or win it?
  Does the "two good executions" counter reset?
A The Pit-Hag cannot turn someone into a character that is in play so this cannot happen.
  Any individual Leviathan does have its own good player executed counter though, if it was not alive and sober to see an execution, it did not count to them.
  
Q With the Leviathan, if the Recluse is the second good player to be executed can they register as evil to continue the game,
  then later change how they register to make evil win at any time?
A No, it is only looked at at the time of execution.

Q Can the Recluse register as evil so that their death not count towards the Leviathan's win condition?
A Yes.

Q The Choirboy is useless in a Leviathan game or is there a special rule like with the Ravenkeeper, the Sage, etc.?
A There is no jinx.
  The King is also usually useless with the Leviathan because the dead will not outnumber the living unless there are a lot of other killing roles.

Q If the Leviathan is executed on day five, and the Scarlet Woman is in the game, what happens?
A The SW becomes the new Levi and the game ends with an evil win.
  Despite it being a new instance of the Levi, the day count is universal and does not reset,
  so the Levi's wincon is met.

Q Is a Pit-Hag making a Leviathan after day 5 an automatic win for evil?
A No, there is a jinx preventing the PH from creating the Levi after day 5.

Q D1 a good player is executed. N2 the Courtier drunks the Leviathan and the next day the Courtier is executed. Does the game end immediately?
A No. The Leviathan was drunk when the Courtier was executed, so they did not see the second execution.

Q The Widow poisons the Leviathan permanently. During the first four days, town executes 2+ good players. On day 5, the Widow is executed.
  Does the sober Leviathan need to see two more good players executed, or does evil win after the Widow is executed?
A The poisoned Leviathan did not "see" any good executions so when she becomes healthy her count is at zero,
  but the healthy and sober Leviathan does win the game because day 5 is over.

Q Can the Leviathan win the game as a regular Demon wincon?
  where there are lots of nightkilling characters in the script, and the Leviathan stays alive with only one remaining alive player?
A Yes, evil's normal win condition of two players alive always applies and ends the game.

Q If the Leviathan gets drunk or poisioned, do the days reset?
A No, the days are universal.  However, any good executions while the Leviathan is drunk or poisoned do not count towards their win condition.

===========
=Librarian=
===========
Q If the only Outsider in play is the Recluse, could the Librarian learn a zero?
A Yes.

=============
=Lil' Monsta=
=============
Q If the Snake Charmer picks the Lil' Monsta's babysitter, what happens?
A They swap characters and alignment.  Do they swap babysitter?  Unknown, but does it matter?
  Whether the SC now holds LM is irrelevant since the SC picks before the LM does,
  so the Minions, which might include the former SC, will wake up after the swap to pick the next babysitter anyhow.

Q Does the Recluse registering as a Minion and waking with the regular Minions to decide who babysits LM register to the Mathematician?
A Yes.

Q Can the Psychopath holding Lil' Monsta kill the Soldier?
A (Standard caveat: there is no write up for Lil' Monsta)
  The concensus is no.

Q Can anyone babysit Lil' Monsta?
A Yes.  LM can be given to any player, as long as the majority of the Minions agree.  The person is then informed that they are babysitting.
  Giving the LM to a good player will usually result in that player announcing such so is not always a good idea.
  Giving the LM to a Traveller who leaves will cause the game to end.

Q Can the ST sink a kill in a Lil' Monsta game?
A Yes.  The ST is free to target players that are already dead or cannot die.  They can even kill evil players.

Q Do evil Townsfolk or Outsiders (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter / ...) wake to choose who babysits Lil' Monsta?
A No, only Minions.

Q The Lunatic, the Marionette and the King are all "the Demon knows who you are" abilities.  How does this work in a Lil' Monsta game?
A Each time the player holding Lil' Monsta changes they become "the Demon" and, the first time they become the babysitter, they are told who those characters are.

  If the Marionette babysits Lil' Monsta, while they still learn the Lunatic and the King,
  they do not learn that they are the Marionette because of the Marionette jinx with Lil' Monsta.

  If the Lunatic is for real given Lil' Monsta (as opposed to the ST simulating this)
  then, as well as learning that they are the babysitter and being shown the King and the Marionette,
  they learn that they are their own Lunatic,
  and are told their own Lunatic choices, because the real Demon learns the Lunatic's choices. 

Q Is a good player holding Lil' Monsta informed that they are the babysitter?
A Yes, they get woken and told that they are holding Lil' Monsta and, as applicable, learns the King, Lunatic and Marionette.
  Except when the Marionette holds LM as they do not learn that they are the Marionette.

Q If the babysitter dies in a Lil' Monsta game that continues (Mastermind / Evil Twin), do the Minions get to choose a new babysitter?
A No, if the babysitter dies so does Lil' Monsta, so the ability cannot continue.

Q Does the Alchemist wake up with the Minions to decide who babysits Lil' Monsta?
A No, the Alchemist is not a Minion, they merely have the ability of an out of play one.

Q Do dead Minions get woken up to decide who babysits Lil' Monsta?
A Yes.

Q Can other killing roles add on to Lil' Monsta's kill?
  Or does LM's ability 'a player dies each night' mean only one player can die each night?
A There can be extra kills due to other abilities on top of Lil' Monsta's kill.

Q In a Lil' Monsta game can there be no deaths at night?
  Perhaps because a player was protected (Innkeeper / Soldier / Monk / ...)
  or sinking a kill to simulate a Mastermind day.
A Yes.

Q If the Courtier drunks Lil' Monsta, what happens?
A For three nights:
  * the Minions do not wake to choose who holds LM; the ST does not wake the Minions to deceive them that they are working normally as no player is LM.
  * nobody dies due to LM.
  * LM cannot move; whoever was holding LM before the Courtier picked will keeping holding LM
  * the player holding LM is not themselves drunk so can still use their ability
  
  Good wins as normal if the babysitter dies.  

  (Standard caveat: there is no write up for Lil' Monsta)

Q In a Lil' Monsta game, what is an evil Traveller told?
A Whoever is currently babysitting.
  If they are present from the start of the game, probably best wait until the babysitter has been decided.

Q Could the Spy babysitting the Lil' Monsta misregister as non-Demon?
A (Standard caveat: there is no write up for Lil' Monsta)
  
  To be fair to the good team and their abilities, perhaps treat the misregistering Spy as if they were a good Townsfolk or Outsider holding LM
  so that abilities that ask "is this a Demon" should still yield a yes.

Q How is Lil' Monsta affected by the Minstrel triggering?
A Unknown. Either:
  * Lil’ Monsta is not affected by the Minstrel; it can kill and change babysitters, even though the Minions are drunk.
  * There are no deaths and the Minions do not wake together.

  Most likely it is the first option, since the Minstrel ability specifies that players are drunked, not characters.

Q If the Good Twin is holding Lil' Monsta and is executed with the Evil Twin alive, which team wins?
A Evil. Because character abilities trump normal game win conditions, except in some situations, including some where LM is involved ...

-------------------------combine
Q If the Exorcist picks the Minion holding Lil' Monsta, does the Minion still get their ability, or any player holding it for that matter?
A Unknown.

Q If the Exorcist picks the player holding Lil' Monsta what happens?
A The Exorcist only ever stops the Demon, if selected, waking up to use their own ability,
  but Lil' Monsta never wakes in order to kill so if the babysitter is selected the LM kill still goes through.
  However, as the babysitter is registering as "the Demon", they do not wake to use their own ability.
  In LM games the Exorcist is essentially a really bad Preacher.
-----------------------------

Q If the good Saint is holding Lil' Monsta and is executed, which team wins?
A Good, because in a tie good wins.

Q If a player holding Lil' Monsta "Barber swaps" herself with a different player, does the Lil' Monsta token stay where it is or does it follow the swap?
A (Standard caveat: there is no write up for Lil' Monsta)
  Best guess: since the Barber only swaps characters, and no player is Lil' Monsta, the Lil' Monsta token likely stays put.

Q Would a good Minion (perhaps caused by a Pit-Hag or Barber swap) learn who all the other Minions are in a Lil' Monsta game?
A Yes. You could prevent it with a house rule that only evil Minions wake.

Q What happens if the public Goblin holding Lil' Monsta is executed?
A Good wins, as it would be impossible for good to win otherwise.

Q Can the Scarlet Woman holding the Lil' Monsta Barber swap with the previous Minion that was holding the Lil' Monsta?
A Yes.

Q What do character checkers (Dreamer / Undertaker / Ravenkeeper / ...) see the Minion holding Lil' Monsta as?
A As their Minion character.  No player is ever Lil' Monsta so no player can be seen as LM by any character checking abilities.

Q Does the player holding Lil' Monsta register as the Demon to the Fortune Teller?
A Yes.
  
Q If the Gambler gambles a player as Lil' Monsta, does she die everytime?
A Yes, a player is never LM.

Q Can the Soldier hold Lil' Monsta?
  Or is being the Demon considered a negative effect?
A The Soldier can hold LM.

Q Does the Preacher affect Lil' Monsta because a Minion most of the time holds the baby.
A The Preacher stops the Minion's ability but not LM's ability to kill and move around.
  "Lil’ Monsta: A Minion who is selected by the Preacher while holding the Lil’ Monsta token loses their Minion ability, but retains their Lil’ Monsta Demon ability."

Q Can Travellers hold Lil' Monsta?
A Yes.

Q In a Teensyville Lil' Monsta game, do the Minions learn each other?
A Yes.

  In five and six player games, the Minion and Demon info steps do not happen, but character abilities still work as normal.
  So the Lil' Monsta ability allows the evil team to learn each other,
  but not until they wake up together to choose who holds LM as the normal Minion info step is still skipped. 

Q Does a Lil' Monsta Lunatic work? Would the Lunatic think they are a Minion?
A No, you will need another demon on the script for the Lunatic to think they are.

Q Does the player holding the Lil' Monsta token register as the Demon to the Flowergirl?
A Yes. The Flowergirl looks back so would learn if the player holding the token in the day voted even if the token moved that night.

Q Is the Scarlet Woman’s ability "reusable” in a Lil' Monsta game?
A Yes, probably, but there is no official LM write up yet so who knows?


========
=Lleech=
========
Q What happens if the Lleech host is the good twin? 
A In order for good to win, the Evil Twin must be killed first and then the good twin.

  Evil always wins if the good twin is ever executed while the Evil Twin is alive.
  So while executing the good twin does kill the Lleech, the living Evil Twin's wincon would trigger, giving evil the win.

Q What happens if the Exorcist chooses the Lleech?
A The Lleech does not wake but their host remains poisoned and must die in order for the Lleech to die.

Q What happens if the Lleech host is the Heretic?
A As per the jinx, the Heretic remains poisoned when the Lleech dies so good can win by executing the Heretic.

Q If the Lleech poisons his Marionette/Lunatic on N1, does he still learn that that player is his Marionette/Lunatic?
A Yes, he will have already learned that player before he picked his host.

Q If the Lycanthrope attacks and kills the Lleech's good host, does the Lleech die despite the Lycanthrope's no other player can die ability?
A The Lleech should probably die too.  Lleech and Lycanthrope may be a problematic pair.

Q Can the Mayor N1 bounce the Lleech to avoid being the host?
A No, they become the host.  They are therefore poisoned and without an ability, unable to win in final 3 or bounce kills at night.

Q Does the Lleech host protected by the Monk become unpoisoned? 
A For that night, yes.

Q If the Monk protects the Lleech, is the Lleech prevented from dying with their host tonight?
A Yes, but as per the drunk or poisoned Lleech host dying rule the Lleech should probably die despite the protection.

Q What happens if a new Lleech is created (Scarlet Woman / Engineer / Pit-Hag / Barber / Hatter / ...)
  and they select as their host the Monk protected player?
A They still become the host, but for that night they are unaffected by the Lleech poison.

Q If the Lleech is in play and the Pit-Hag makes a second Demon, what happens?
A Deaths are arbitrary, so the ST should pick whichever option makes the most sense for that particular game at that particular moment:
﻿  * kill the Lleech, which means the host must also die (poisoned but then become healthy);
  * kill the newly created Demon instead.

Q Does resurrecting the Lleech host (Professor) also resurrect the Lleech?
A No.

Q In a final five that includes the Lleech, their host and the Scarlet Woman, the host is executed and dies, so the Lleech dies, does the SW become the Lleech?
A RAW the SW becomes the Lleech, chooses their host, then kills that night, resulting in a loss for the good team.
  Some STs houserule this interaction to avoid situations where good cannot win, such as not allowing the SW to kill the same night that they become the new Lleech.
  
  There is a similar conflict between the Shabaloth and the SW.

Q What is the Slayer jinx with the Lleech?
A If the Slayer slays the Lleech's host, the host dies, and the Lleech dies too if they are sober and healthy.

Q Can the Soldier, who is safe from the all the harmful effects of the Demon, be the Lleech host?
A Yes.

  Dying, being poisoned, and turning evil are examples of harmful effects.
  Being the Lleech host is not a harmful effect, because when the host dies so does the Demon,
  and that benefits the good team.

  So the Soldier is not poisoned by the Lleech, but they are still their host.

Q Does the Lleech's host die poisoned, should the game continue for some reason (Scarlet Woman / Mastermind / Evil Twin / ...)?
A Yes.

Q Does the Lleech host register as evil?
A Only if they are already evil, because they are a Minion or where turned evil (Goon / Cult Leader / Bounty Hunter / ...).
  If the host is good, then they will register as good to alignment checkers like the Empath.

Q When there is a new Lleech (Scarlet Woman / Hatter / Barber / Snake Charmer / ...), is another host chosen?
A Yes.  The same host can be chosen, depending on how the new Lleech is created.

Q Can the Lleech host be a Traveller?
A Yes, although they rarely make good hosts: if the Traveller host is exiled or they leave, then they die, so the Lleech dies too.

Q What is the ruling for the Lleech being drunked or poisoned when either they or their host is executed?
A If the Lleech is drunk:
  # they die when executed
  # they do not die when the host dies
  # they become immortal if the second point happens even when they become sober again, unless the recommended ruling is run that the Lleech dies even if drunk when the host dies.

Q Can the Lleech self-host?
A Yes.  They are self-poisoned for the rest of the game meaning they cannot kill at night and can die.

Q If the Lleech becomes a different Demon (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Engineer / ...), does the Lleech host become healthy?
A Yes.

Q If the Lleech makes it to final three, is that an instant evil win? Since if the host is executed, that would create a final two before the Lleech dies.
A If the Lleech host is executed in final three, the good team wins, as the Lleech and the host die simultaneously.
  This is a rare example of simultaneous death in Clocktower.

Q If a new Lleech is made (Scarlet Woman / Pit-Hag / Engineer / Hatter / ...) when do they select a host?
A A new Lleech chooses their host as soon as possible, then follows that by choosing a kill. 



=========
=Lunatic=
=========
Q What does the Demon learn when the Lunatic thinks that they are the Yaggababble?
A Just who the Lunatic is.

  The Demon learns who the Lunatic picks, and if the Lunatic does not or cannot pick anyone, the Demon learns nothing.

Q What does the Demon learn if their Lunatic Po charges / Lunatic Zombuul does not wake?
A Nothing.

  The Demon learns who the Lunatic chooses, and if they do not choose anyone for whatever reason then they learn nothing.

Q Does the Lunatic learn that they are evil if they are turned by the Mezepheles?
A All players learn if they change alignment, even the Lunatic.

Q Does the Demon learn who the Lunatic Lleech chose as their host?
A The Demon learns who their Lunatic picks on N1 but does not learn what Demon they believe they are,
  so from the Demon's perspective they could be learning who the Lunatic Pukka picked to poison.

Q What happens when the Lunatic picks the Goon?
A If the Lunatic is the first to pick the Goon at night then:
  * the Goon is flipped to good / stays good
  * the Lunatic is drunked, so the ST deceives them that their ability, that they belive they are the Demon, is still working
  * the Demon is not informed of the Lunatic's picks that night

  When a player is drunk or poisoned, they are deceived into believing that their ability is working normally.
  The first part of the Lunatic's ability is a "you think" ability, which means deceiving the player about what they are.  
  So a drunk or poisoned Lunatic is deceived into believing that their ability is working normally ... which is to believe that they are some other character.
  So nothing has changed.
  
  However, drunkeness or poisoning does shut down the other mechanical part of their ability,
  which is to inform the Demon of their picks.

Q Can you tell the Lunatic that they have been snake charmed?
A No, because the Lunatic's ability is that they think that they _are_ the Demon, not that they _were_ the Demon.
  If they are told that they are the good Snake Charmer then they are no longer being deceived that they are the Demon.

Q Does a drunk or poisoned Lunatic's pick(s) get shown to the Demon?
A No.

Q If the Courtier drinks with the Lunatic, does the Lunatic still believe that they are the Demon?
A Yes. The Lunatic will have pulled their Demon token out of the bag and learned fake info before the Courtier would be able to drink with them.

  While the Lunatic is drunk (by Courtier or otherwise)
  the ST treats them like the Demon that they think they are, waking them up to get their choices
  but the actual Demon is not informed of their picks.

Q If the Courtier drinks with the Lunatic on day one, would the Demon learn of the Lunatic?
A Yes.
  On night one, both the Lunatic waking to learn their fake information and the Demon waking to learn their real information happens before the Courtier acts.

  However, if a droisoned player is turned into the Lunatic, the Demon would not learn about them until the Lunatic is sober/healthy,
  When the new Lunatic does become sober/healthy the Demon would be informed as soon as possible.

Q Does the Lunatic have to think they are an _evil_ Demon?
A No, if it is believable that there is a troll Pit-Hag in the game,
  and someone becomes the Lunatic on a later night, a good Demon is reasonable.
  However, the starting Lunatic needs to think they are the evil Demon character because there is almost no way anything else could happen.
  It would need a skilled ST to convince the Lunatic that an Amnesiac ability put a good Demon in the bag.
  


Q Does the Demon learn the Lunatic in Teensyville?
A Yes, that is a function of the Lunatic ability,
  and all character abilities function normally in a game with five or six players.

Q The Lleech picks the Lunatic N1.  Does the Lleech learn who the Lunatic picks at night?
A No, the Lunatic is poisoned.

Q If the Lunatic thinks that they are the Lleech, does the Demon learn who they picked N1?
A Yes.
  The Lunatic ability reads "and who you choose at night", so the Demon learns who they picked. 
  But the Demon does not learn why they picked,
  so if the Pukka and the Lleech are on the script, then the Demon would not know which token the Lunatic saw, which might cause issues on N2 when deciding who to kill.

Q Can the Lunatic be told that another player is the Lunatic?
A Yes, but this can lead to the ST controlling the kills:
  * the ST chooses a kill for the fake Lunatic and informs the Lunatic, 
  * the Lunatic attacks the fake Lunatic's target to keep up the lie,
  * the Demon attacks the same target to keep up the lie.

  The ST can do this if their group is cool with the idea
  or perhaps to ensure seeing the Lunatic token does not confirm someone as the Demon.

  How to simulate the Lunatic to the Lunatic without dictating the kills:
  * have the Lunatic think that they are, for example, the Po
  * the actual Demon is the Pukka, and is shown to the Lunatic as their fake Lunatic (Demons never know what Demon their Lunatic thinks they are)
  * N1, the Pukka (actual Demon) picks player X
  * N2, the ST tells the Lunatic that their Lunatic (actual Demon) just tried to kill player X
  * and so on. Because the Pukka kills out of sync, the issue is solved.

-----combine
Q If the Lunatic thinks that they are the Fang Gu and the Fang Gu jumps to them, what are they told?
A They woken and told that they are the Fang Gu and are evil.

  Their character and alignment changed, and they no longer have the Lunatic ability that allows the ST to lie about it.
﻿
Q If the Lunatic-Fang Gu is Fang Gu-jumped, is she told that she is now evil?
A The ST informs the new Demon of their character and alignment as it changed and they no longer have the Lunatic ability.

Q If the Fang Gu jumps into the Lunatic who sees himself as the Fang Gu, does the ST still tell the Lunatic again that he is the Fang Gu?
A Yes. Players learn when their character and alignment have changed, 
  and the Lunatic will be a real Fang Gu meaning they no longer any character ability that allows some deception with that anymore. 
  They are actually changing character and alignment even though it is to what they may have already thought.

  So the ST would wake them up and inform tell them "You are the Fang Gu, you are evil." 
----

Q The Lunatic is good but believes they are an evil Demon.
  If the Pit-Hag turns the Lunatic into a Demon, will the Lunatic learn, along with their new role, that they are actually good?
 
A No, they do not learn their alignment because their alignment has not changed.

  When the Lunatic is Pit-Hagged into a Demon, they only have to be told their new role.
  They were good and are still good, so their alignment has not changed.
  If it is a new player, it might be helpful for the ST to tell them their alignment, but for experienced players this is not necessary.
  If the Lunatic actually turned evil due to a Fang Gu jump then they would learn they are now evil.

  In general, players only learn when their alignment changes, and if a player were to enquire about their alignment should be told something like "your alignment has not changed".

  A similar scenario to the pithagged Lunatic is the Marionette who when catching a star pass is not informed they are evil because their alignment has not changed.

Q If the Lunatic is Pit-Hagged into the Demon she already thinks she is, what is she told?
A The new Demon is reinformed of her character, as it changed and she no longer has the Lunatic ability.

Q If the Lunatic is Pit-Hagged into another role, they are told their new role, but are they told that they are in fact good?
A No, their role has changed, but not their alignment, and players should only be informed of their alignment when it changes.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns a player into the Lunatic, does the ST tell that player that they are evil?
A No.  The Lunatic's ability is "You think you are a Demon, but you are not. The Demon knows who you are and who you choose at night.".
  With the Pit-Hag on the script it is very believable someone could be made a good Demon,
  and that is all that is required of the Lunatic, to believe they are a Demon of some kind.

Q Can the ST fake the Poppy Grower is in play and not show fake Minions to the Lunatic?
A Yes.

  The ST is already lying to the player that they are the Demon,
  so they can lie about them being affected by the Poppy Grower, even when they are not in the game.

  Anything on the script that could happen or be told to the Demon can be simulated for the Lunatic:
  * fake Magician, by showing an extra "Minion"
  * fake King,
  * fake Marionette,
  * fake Exorcist, ...

  The ST is also free to give the Lunatic correct info when these characters are really in play.

Q Can the ST make the Lunatic who has figured out what they are believe that they have been Fang Gu jumped?
A Yes.

Q The Pit-Hag changes a player into the Lunatic. Would it be valid to first wake them, tell them they are an Outsider of some type, 
  put them to sleep and pretend to continue with the night order, then wake them telling them they were Fang Gu jumped?
A No, their ability does not make them think that they are an Outsider.

Q Does the Demon learn what character the Lunatic Ojo targeted?
A No, they are shown the player who the Lunatic Ojo functionally targeted, i.e. the player with that character.

Q What is the Demon shown when the Lunatic Ojo picks an out of play role?
A Nothing.

  The Lunatic says the Demon learns who they picked, and the Ojo says picking an out of play character is the ST's choice not the player's, so the Lunatic Ojo did not pick anyone.

Q If the Hatter dies, can the Lunatic be given the choice to change characters?
A Yes, this does not even need the actual Hatter to die.



=============
=Lycanthrope=
=============
Q If the Lycanthrope is drunk or poisoned, does none of their ability take effect?
A Correct, they cannot kill and other deaths are not prevented.

Q If the Lycanthrope self-kills are they the only death this night?
A No, the dead Lycanthrope has no ability so they are unable to prevent other deaths tonight.

Q What happens when the Lycanthrope successfully kills a good player in an Al-Hadikhia game?
A No one can die to the Al-Hadikhia regardless of their live/die choices but players can still be resurrected.

Q If the Lycanthrope chooses a good player and a Godfather chooses to use their ability, does the Godfather ability get wasted?
A The Godfather does not choose when they use it,
  but the Godfather kill also does not go through when the Lycan picks a good player.
  This is unlike the Assassin, which kills despite the Lycan protection.

Q The Lycanthrope attacks a good player, then the Pit-Hag creates a new Demon.  How many deaths can occur that night?
A The Pit-Hag acts first in the night order so deaths are completely arbitrary which can include blocking the Lycanthrope kill.

Q If the Lycanthrope attacks a good player who does not die (sober Soldier / Tea Lady protection / Innkeeper protection / unspent Fool / ...)
  is it a no death night?
A No, other players can still die tonight due to other characters’ abilities.

  The killing a good player and the no one else can die are directly linked, and if the first does not happen then the second does not activate.

Q If the Lycanthrope attacks the Mayor who bounces the kill, what happens?
A The ST has a choice of who to bounce the kill to:
  * a good player who dies, meaning no further deaths that night;
  * a good player who cannot die, meaning other kills can happen that night,
  * an evil player, who cannot die since the source of the attack is still considered to be the Lycan, so other deaths can happen tonight.

Q Can the Lycanthrope kill the Lleech host, ending the game?
A Yes, assuming the Lleech chose a good player as their host (the Lleech does occasionally pick Minions).

Q How does the Pukka interact with the Lycanthrope?
  If the Lycan prevents the death of a Pukka poisoned target, do they remain poisoned? 
  Or, in other words, does a Pukka chosen target have to die in order to become healthy?
A No, the Lycan-protected and Pukka-poisoned player becomes a healthy (and living) player.

  The order of events would look something like this:
  *N1 - The Pukka poisons player A.
  *N2 - The Lycanthrope kills a good player and the Pukka chooses player B. 
        Player B is poisoned and player A becomes healthy and does not die since the Lycanthrope ability worked successfully.

Q What is the Gambler jinx with the Lycanthrope?
A If the Gambler gambles someone incorrectly and dies while there is an alive Lycan ability,
  they are the only player who can die that night, just like if the Lycan chose them.
  
  * the alignment of the Lycan's pick is irrelevant
  * no other deaths due to other abilities go through, which includes the Lycan's and the Demon's picks
  * whether the Lycan is drunk or poisoned is RAW irrelevant

Q If the Lycanthrope kills a good player, and the Demon picks the Lycanthrope, does only the good player die?
A Yes.

==========
=Magician=
==========
Q What impact on the game would a mid game created Magician or Poppy Grower (Damsel / Pit-Hag / Barber / ...) have?
A Almost certainly none.  The Damsel gaining such an ability would not have any fun.

Q Can the Evil Twin be twinned with the Magician?
A Yes.  The Evil Twin would see the Demon token as the Magician's character... which would immediately expose the Magician.

Q Does a N1 Barista 1 have an effect on the Demon or a Minion when there is a Magician in play?
A Yes, that player would not be shown the Magician.
  A Barista 1 Evil Twin paired with the Magician would see them as the Magician instead of the Demon, and cause a +1 to the Mathematician.
  
Q If the Magician neighbours the No Dashii, do they affect the Demon / Minion info stages?
A No, they are poisoned.

Q How is the Magician run in a Legion game?
A The Magician's vote counts as a good vote and causes an execution to pass if sufficient. 

  Each Legion must be woken up individually to be told their other Demon players in order to maintain the Magician illusion,
  so any time the Magician is on the script with Legion,
  all Legion players should wake separately to see their fellow "Legion" players so that Legion players cannot tell if the Magician is in play or not.

Q If the Mastermind or the Scarlet Woman thinks that the Magician is the Demon, does their ability trigger when the Magician is executed?
A No.

  While the Mastermind/SW player will think the Magician is the Demon,
  their ability does not register the Magician as the Demon,
  so it is not triggered on the Magician’s execution.

Q Can the Marionette be sat next to the Magician rather than the Demon?
A No.

  The Minions only think the Magician is the Demon, the Magician does not register as the Demon.
  However, a Magician sat next to the Demon can be shown to the Demon as the Marionette.

Q What is the Magician jinx with Lil' Monsta?
A They follow the hate jinx rule: only one jinxed character can be in play.

Q Is the Magician's ability affected by the Vortox?
A No.

Q How does the Magician work when there the Spy or the Widow are in play?
A As per the jinx: 
  "When the Spy/Widow sees the Grimoire, the Demon and Magician's character tokens are removed."
  The ST also removes any relevant reminder tokens as well so that it is not obvious despite the lack of character token.

Q Can the Imp starpass to the Magician?
A No.

Q Do evil Townsfolk or Outsiders (Bounty Hunter / Mezepheles) see the Magician?
A No, only Minions or Demons.

Q How does the Magician work in a Poppy Grower game?
A If the Magician is alive when the Poppy Grower dies then it affects the Minion/Demon info step exactly how it would have done N1.

Q If the Magician ability comes into play after N1, do Demons and Minions learn information on the player with the Magician ability? 
A In a Poppy Grower game they might, otherwise no.

  The Minions and the Demon learn of the Magician during the info phase which happens N1.
  So unless the Poppy Grower was in play from the start of the game and delayed the info phase until after the Magician's creation, 
  the evil team would not learn about the mid game Magician.

Q If the Philosopher drunks the Magician N1, does the actual Magician’s ability happen when the Philo dies?
  Does Demon and Minion info happen again midway through the game?
A No, because by that time the deception has already failed. 
  Similarly, a Pit-Hag creating a Magician mid game would not cause the Minions and Demon to redo their info steps.

--------------------rewrite
Q Does the Demon immediately know who one of her Minions is if the Marionette and the Magician are in the same game? Can the Demon think the Magician is their Marionette?
A When the Magician and the Marionette are in the game together, the Demon will learn one Minion as her Marionette and the rest as non-Marionette Minions.
  She will immediately figure out the Magician is in the game,
  but if the Magician is sat next to the Demon or the Recluse then the Demon can be told the Magician is her Marionette,
  so learning the Marionette does not immediately mean the Demon knows for sure who one of her Minions is.

Q In a one minion game, with the Marionette and the Magician in play, does the Demon just learn both players without learning one is the Marionette?
A They would learn both as Minions, and learn the Marionette as the Marionette,
  but they would not know for sure if their Marionette was actually the Magician and the other Minion was a non-Marionette.

  The Magician's ability is that the Demon thinks they are a Minion, and that can include a specific Minion if relevant
  similar to how the Lunatic can be lied to about different things in order to keep up the ruse that they are the Demon.

  If the Magician was in the game and the Minion was not the Marionette, 
  then, if the Magician was sat next to the Demon or the Recluse, the Demon could learn the Magician as the Marionette.
-----------------------------

============
=Marionette=
============
Q If the Marionette Artist asks if they are the Marionette, can the ST answer 'yes'?
A Yes.

Q Could the Marionette believe that she is the Atheist?
A Yes, though it might require an alternate setup to make that happen.

Q What is the Balloonist jinx with the Marionette?
A If the Marionette thinks that they are the Balloonist, +1 Outsider was added.

Q If the Bounty Hunter is the Marionette, is a Townsfolk player still made evil?
A No.

Q What happens when the Cannibal eats the Marionette?
A The Cannibal is poisoned and is usually deceived that they have the ability the Marionette thought they had.

Q Can the Marionette Choirboy be woken up and told the Demon when there is no King in the game?
A Yes, but getting that setup is tricky as the Choirboy requires the King and you do not know at setup that they will be the Marionette.

Q What happens if the Courtier picks the Marionette?
A Nothing.

  N1 the Marionette ability of thinking they are good and neighbouring the Demon has already happened.
  On other nights the ST still deceives a drunk Marionette that their ability is working, that is they think that they are a good character.

Q Can the Marionette Damsel be woken up and told that they became a Townsfolk when there is no Huntsman in the game?
A Yes.

Q What happens if a player chooses the Marionette with the Hatter ability?
A The ST informs that player that they are a good character and tells the Demon who their Marionette is.

Q After the Hatter dies, is the Marionette woken and given a choice?
A Yes. This hard confirms to them that they are the Marionette, similar to if the Preacher picks them.

Q Who learns the Marionette in a Lil' Monsta game?
A Anyone, except the Marionette (jinx), who babysits LM learns the Marionette.

Q What is the Marionette jinx with Lil' Monsta?
A The Marionette neighbours a Minion.
  The Marionette is not woken to choose who takes the Lil' Monsta token.

Q Can the Lunatic be the Marionette?
A ST choice.

  The TPI consider 'yes, they can' and 'no, they cannot' to both be valid rulings, so the ST should pick their preference and inform their players which they run:
  # The Marionette cannot think they are the Lunatic as the Lunatic thinks they are evil,
    which contradicts the Marionette thinking they are good,
    so the Lunatic cannot be the Marionette.
  # The Marionette can think they are a good character that themselves thinks they are the Demon. 

  If the preference is 'no they cannot' and the Demon lands between the Lunatic and a Minion then, if there is no Recluse in the game, that would need a rerack.
  To prevent this from happening an alternative setup should be used,
  such as placing an extra Townsfolk token in the bag instead of the Lunatic,
  then after the tokens are distributed,
  deciding which of the Townsfolk players to make the Lunatic,
  informing that they are a Demon from the script
  and showing them the Townsfolk token that they received as one of their bluffs.

Q Does the Marionette ping the Mathematician every time they use the ability that they think they have?
A No; the Marionette’s supposed good ability works abnormally due to their own ability, so does not register to the Mathematician.

Q Can the Marionette be shown a fake Nightwatchman ping?
A General consensus is no, because deceiving them about that is not part of the Marionette's "think" ability.
  
  Unlike for example deceiving the Lunatic that they were picked by the Exorcist, which is part of them thinking that they are the Demon.

Q Does the Preacher on N1 picking the Marionette block the Demon from learning about them?
A No.

  The Marionette ability happens before the Preacher picks on N1 so cannot stop the Marionette placement or prevent the Demon from knowing about the Marionette.
  The Marionette is woken as usual to be told that they have been preached.

Q What happens when the Preacher selects the Marionette?
A The Marionette is woken and learns the Preacher chose them.
  They are not explicitly told that they are evil or the Marionette, but will probably be able to figure it out.

  As they lose their ability that makes them "think they are a good character",
  the ST stops deceiving them: they are no longer woken if they previously believed that they had a Townsfolk ability that acted at night.

Q Can the Recluse next to the Demon be the actual Marionette?
A Yes.

Q Can the Marionette in setup be placed next to the Recluse, and not the Demon?
A Yes.
  And it is a N1 +1 to the Mathematician too.

Q Can the Marionette neighbour the Recluse registering as the Demon?
A Yes. It is still best to inform the actual Demon of the Marionette, not the Recluse, otherwise that would out a player who does not even know that they are evil to a good player.
  This also tells the Demon that one of the Marionette's neighbours is the Recluse.


Q What are the restrictions on who can be the Marionette?
A Anyone can be the Marionette except:
  * the Damsel, when the Huntsman is in play;
  * the King, when the Choirboy is in play. 

  The Marionette must neighbour the Demon, or the Recluse who is registering as the Demon.

Q If the Demon moves mid game (Snake Charmer / Barber / Pit-Hag / Fang Gu / Imp / Lil’ Monsta / Matron / Hatter / ... ),
  does the Marionette stay where they are?
A Yes, the Marionette does not move with the Demon, as neighbouring the Demon is a setup ability that has no effect later in the game.

  The new Demon would, however, be told who the Marionette is.

Q Do the other Minions learn of the Marionette?
A No.

  During Minion info they are told one fewer Minion, from which they will deduce that the Marionette is in play.
  To find out who that is, they will need to talk to their Demon.

Q Does the Demon learn the Marionette in Teensyville games?
A Yes, that is a function of the Marionette ability, and all character abilities function normally in a game with five or six players.

  The Marionette is the only Minion the Demon will learn in a Teensyville, unless the Toymaker fabled is in play, as the Demon and Minion info steps are skipped.

Q Can the Marionette think that she is an Outsider?
A Yes.

Q The restrictions on the Marionette at setup, namely that they are evil believing they are a good player and they are sat either next to the Demon or the Recluse registering as the Demon ... 
  do they apply mid game for the purposes of the Barber / Pit-Hag / Engineer / Hatter / ...?
A No.
  The new Marionette:
  * does not need to neighbour the Demon, or a player registering as the Demon
  * is allowed to be a good player

  If the Engineer is responsible for the new Marionette then the ST can pick any of the existing Minions to swap.

Q What happens when a new Marionette is created mid game (Barber / Pit-Hag / Engineer / Hatter / ...)?
A The ST:
  * informs the Demon of the new Marionette;
  * does not tell the new Mario anything about their alignment as it has not changed.
  
  The player is not informed that they are the Marionette, instead the ST either shows the player:
  * the "you are" info token and any Townsfolk or Outsider token,
  * nothing, if they were previously were a Townsfolk or Outsider.
    
  Effectively the player is now like the Drunk and the ST will now treat the Marionette as the character that they saw.

Q The starting Marionette believes that they are a good role.
  But if they swap character (Imp self-kills / Pit-Hag / Barber / ...) and so no longer have an ability that deceives them about their alignment,
  are they informed that they are evil?
A RAW no, as players are only notified of their alignment when it changes.
  So the ST only informs them of their new character.
  
  If they became a Demon and directly ask the ST what their alignment is,
  the ST can reply "you are evil" or "you have not been informed of an alignment change."
  For newer players who are confused it may be best to clarify that they are evil,
  whereas the second response could be given to more experienced players who know how the Marionette works. 

Q Does a Marionette Townsfolk receive misinformation?
A The Marionette is not actually a Townsfolk, and so is unaffected by the Vortox.
  The ST can treat them as if they were drunk or poisoned, but they are not.
  They can be given any information, good or bad,
  in order to deceive them in to thinking that they are the Townsfolk character that they saw.
  
Q In a 13+ player game, there are three Minions. If one Minion is going to be the Marionette, only two Minion tokens are put in the bag.
  If once the roles are given out both Minion tokens are drawn by the two players neighbouring the Demon, 
  what can the ST do?
A Options are:
    # Change a player to a Minion,
    # seat the Marionette next to the Reluse if there is one,
    # scrap the Marionette from the game and instead change a good player into the remaining Minion (but remember to still respect character type counts),
    # rerack.

  One possible way to avoid this scenario:
  # When preparing the bag the ST places two Minion tokens and no Demon token.
  # Choose two adjacent players who drew good tokens to be the Demon and the Marionette.
  # Give the Demon the character that they drew as one of their bluffs, to avoid giving them a free fourth bluff
  
  Some players dislike this method as it amounts to the ST assigning characters rather than letting the players.

Q If an Outsider is made into the Marionette,
  which would make one less Outsider in the game than it is supposed to be,
  is it still a legal setup?
A Yes. In this scenario the Marionette has acted like a soft -1 Outsider modifier.

Q If the Demon changes player
  (Fang Gu jump / new Lil' Monsta babysitter / Imp self-kills / Snake Charmer correctly guesses / Pit-Hag creates a new Demon / Barber swap / Hatter / Scarlet Woman / Engineer / ...),
  do they learn the Marionette, the Lunatic and the King?
A Yes.

  These are all "the Demon knows who you are" abilities, which apply while these characters are alive and in play.
  If the Demon changes player,
  then the new Demon player must be told who each of them is.
  If the Demon ever changes back to a previous player, they are not told again.

Q If a dead player becomes the Marionette (Pit-Hag / Barber / ...) does the Demon still learn them?
A No, the dead Marionette has no ability.

Q Do character checkers (Juggler / Gambler / Dreamer / Undertaker / Ravenkeeper / Harlot / ...) see the Marionette as the Marionette?
A Yes, as this is their true character.


============
=Mastermind=
============
Q On a Mastermind day nobody is executed.  What happens?
A If no one is executed on a Mastermind day, the normal victory conditions kick back in,
  which usually means good wins.
  
  But the game can continue if for example:
  * another Demon enters play
  * the Evil Twin is still alive

Q What happens in a game with the Mastermind when the Lleech's host is executed?
A The Lleech does not die, but they no longer have any ability; that night they do not kill.
  The next day, if a good player is executed evil wins.  Otherwise good wins.

Q If the Demon is executed and the following day the Apprentice Mastermind is exiled, does good win?
A Yes.

Q On a Mastermind day after the Demon is killed, when either the Spy or the Recluse is executed, is the winner completely up to the ST?
A Mechanically, the ST can make either team lose if either a Spy or Recluse is executed via misregistration.
  But the recommendation is not to have any misregistering on a Mastermind day;
  killing the Recluse would be an evil win, and killing the Spy would be a good win.

  Fearmonger and Mastermind do not play well with the misregistration abilities
  because if the ST uses the misregistration abilities players will feel like the ST entirely decided which team won.

Q If the Demon is executed and dies in F3 with the Mastermind and one good player still alive, does the game continue into a F2 day?
A Yes.
  The Mastermind's ability is to "play for 1 more day", and character abilities override normal game rules.
  A F2 day with Mastermind and a "dead" Zombuul is also a typical situation so the players will need to figure out what happened.

Q If there is a Mastermind ability in play and the Demon is executed ending the game, a Mastermind day triggers.
  If a new demon is created or some other mechanic would allow the game to otherwise continue after the Mastermind day has triggered, does the Mastermind day continue?
A The Mastermind's ability is still in effect even though the game can now continue without it:
  If no one is executed the game would continue but if someone is executed that player loses

  If, upon the execution of a Demon, causing there to be a ‘Mastermind day’, 
  another Demon comes into play, or another character that causes the game to continue comes into play, 
  the game can continue beyond the ‘Mastermind day’, 
  however the Mastermind ability still functions upon an execution on said ‘Mastermind day’. 

  If the Demon is executed, causing the Mastermind ability to function and cause a proceeding ‘Mastermind day’,
  then another Demon comes into play, an execution will end the game, with the team of the player being executed losing.

  An Evil Twin being brought into play would allow the evil team to win upon the execution of a good player on a ‘Mastermind day’,
  however if an evil player were executed (or no execution occurred) on said ‘Mastermind day’
  then the game would continue with the Evil Twin ability needing to be resolved 

Q Does the Mastermind trigger after the Zombuul dies for a second time?
A Yes. This is the only time the MM does trigger with the Zombuul.

Q On a Mastermind day, if the Politician was nominated and determined to have done enough to flip, would evil win or would good win?
  i.e. does the Politician alignment change happen after the Mastermind had resolved the game?
A The Politician flips after the game ends, so evil wins.

Q If the Demon is killed by another way than execution, such as to the Gunslinger, the Mastermind cannot use its ability, right?
A Correct.

===============
=Mathematician=
===============


Q If the Barista 1 Townsfolk targeting the unpicked Goon is not made drunk ... does this register to the Mathematician?
A Yes.  The Goon failing to drunk the first player to pick her means that her ability worked abnormally.

Q Does the drunk / poisoned Cult Leader that could have changed alignments ping the Mathematician?
A If both of the droisoned Cult Leader's neighbours are the opposite alignment to the CL's, then the Mathematician is pinged.
  If one neighbour is good and the other evil, then although they could technically ping the Mathematician, they probably should not.

Q If the Lunatic believes she is a multi-kill Demon when the Demon is a single kill Demon (or vice versa), 
  would the Mathematician inherently be pinged every night?
A Yes.

  The Lunatic's jinx with the Mathematician is that the Mathematician learns if the Lunatic attacks a different player(s) than the real Demon attacks,
  and this would include attacking different numbers of players 

Q If either the Lunatic or the Demon is the Po that charges while the other attacks, does that alert the Mathematician?
A Yes.

  The Lunatic's jinx with the Mathematician is that the Mathematician learns if the Lunatic attacks a different player(s) than the real Demon attacks,
  and attacking no one is different to attacking someone.

Q The drunked or poisoned Cannibal uses an info gathering ability during the day, receiving false info.
  After that day's execution, the Cannibal gains a new protection ability that she uses it that night
  on another player who is attacked and dies.
  One player with two abilities that malfunctioned.  How many times is the Mathematician pinged?
A Once, it is the _Cannibal_ ability that has malfunctioned.

Q Does the Cannibal being poisoned after an evil player (Minion / Demon / evil turned Townsfolk / ...) is executed ping the Mathematician?
A No, as it is the Cannibal's own ability that is poisoning them.
  If another character is poisoning them then the Mathematician would be pinged.

Q Do Minions targeted by the Preacher register to the Mathematician?
A The Mathematician is only pinged if the Minion would have done something or woken to use their ability that night.

  For example after preaching:
  * the Baron never wakes for any reason: no pings, there is nothing to work abnormally;
  * the Poisoner no longer wakes up each night to poison someone: pings the Mathematician every night they are alive and preached;
  * the Evil Twin, when the twin info has already gone out, and the good twin is not executed: no ping tonight;
  * the Evil Twin is not woken to be informed of the good twin's new character: ping for the Mathematician tonight;
  * the evil team does not win after the good twin is executed: ping for the Mathematician tonight.

Q Does the self poisoning Widow trigger the Mathematician?
A No, the Mathematician only detects abnormalities due to other players' abilities.

Q After the Pit-Hag creates a Demon and deaths are arbitrary, is the Demon's kill being blocked a +1 to the Mathematician?
A Yes.

Q Does the Assassin bypassing another character's protection (Fool / Sailor / Tea Lady / Innkeeper / ...) give a +1 to the Mathematician?
A Yes, the Assassin's ability is causing another player's protection ability to work abnormally.

Q If the Al-Hadikhia chooses the Soldier, the sober Sailor, and the Tea Lady protected player, and they all choose death, would that register as a six for the Mathematician?
A It registers as a one.

  The Mathematician counts the number of abilities that work abnormally, not how many times they malfunctioned.

Q What is the interaction between the Mathematician and the Magician?
  Does the Mathematician pick up on the Demons' and Minions' abilities "not working properly", as it does whenever the Spy or the Recluse interacts with a character?
A No, because the Mathematician counts how many abilities malfunctioned,
  and Demon and Minion info is not happening due to their character abilities, rather due to their character type and game rules.

  Although, interestingly, in a game with the Poppy Grower and the Magician,
  the Poppy Grower dying and giving the Demon and Minions their info is considered part of the Poppy Grower ability,
  meaning that the Mathematician would detect if the Magician ability caused the Demon and Minions to learn an extra player from the Poppy Grower ability.

Q Does the Exorcist preventing the Demon from waking up lead to a +1 for the Mathematician?
A Yes, the Demon's ability is working abnormally due to the Exorcist.

Q How do Pit-Hag arbitrary deaths register to the Mathematician?
A The Pit-Hag’s arbitrary death ability allows the ST to kill any player and protect any player from death.
  So if the Demon's target does not die due to the PH allowing the ST to protect that player, 
  that is +1 to the Mathematician (place an abnormal token on the Demon). 
  If the ST uses the Pit-Hag’s ability to kill additional players,
  then that is the PH's ability functioning normally,
  so that is not a +1 to the Mathematician.

Q If the Philosopher picks an ability while poisoned,
  do they register a single abnormality to the Mathematician and then never again,
  or do they register an abnormality each time they think they use their ability and it functions improperly? 
A They would ping the Mathematician every time they attempted to use the ability they think they gained and it produces a wrong result,
  because the ST is only able to do that while the Philosopher is continuously drunk or poisoned,
  so it is still due to another character's ability that such deception is even possible.

Q If a new Mathematician is created (Pit-Hag, Barber swapped, ...) 
  would they read the "abnormal" tokens placed the previous day,
  or does the new ability instance mean they only "see" malfunctionings that happen after they entered play?
A They would see all abnormalities from the day.

Q If the Juggler juggles but the next night she is turned by the Pit-Hag, she does not her info. Does this register to the Mathematician?
A No. Her ability did not function abnormally at any point; which ability she had simply changed.

Q The Cannibal eats the Drunk. Does that count to the Mathematician?
A No, the Cannibal is working as intended.

Q Does the Mathematician detect players affected by drunking / poisoning / misregistration?
A Only if the player's ability works differently to what their ability states.

  The Mathematician is pinged when, for example:
  * the Grandmother sees the Spy who misregistered as a good role,
  * the Recluse misregistering as a Minion poisons the Cannibal,
  * the Recluse misregisters as evil to the Chef,
  * the poisoned Slayer targets the Demon who does not die,
  * the drunk Fisherman receives bad advice,
  * the poisoned Soldier dies to the Demon's attack,
  * the poisoned, but not self-poisoned, Snake Charmer chooses the Demon,
  * the Poisoner fails to poison the Goon who drunks them instead.

  If a player still gets true info despite drunking / poisoning / misregistration,
  then their ability has functioned exactly as it should and the Mathematician is not pinged:
  * the poisoned Artist receives a correct answer,
  * the Empath sat between the Recluse misregistering as evil and the Spy registering as a Townsfolk correctly received a one.

  The Mathematician is not pinged if a drunked / poisoned mechanical ability is not used, or does nothing which is the expected result:
  * the drunk Slayer targets a non-Demon,
  * the target of the drunk Devil's Advocate protection is executed.

Q If a role that acts during the day (Slayer / Fisherman / ...) is poisoned at night, when is the Mathematician pinged?
A Not on the night of the poisoning but the following night and only
  if the player attempted to use their ability during the day and it worked abnormally.

Q Does the Pit-Hag picking a character that is in play register to the Mathematician?
A No, because their ability is working normally according to their own ability text.
  Besides, even if this was classified as a malfunction,
  it is due to their own ability, and not another character's ability.

Q Do Djinn jinxes register as abnormalities to the Mathematician?
  For example:
  * the Pit-Hag creating the Damsel and then the ST picking who to be the Damsel;
  * the Spy not seeing the Grimoire due to the Poppy Grower; ...
A There is no official stance or concensus on Djinn jinxes and the Mathematician.
  One opinion is that those are rules for how the characters work together so are not abnormalities.

Q The ST Poisoner, made by the Plague Doctor dying, poisons a Townsfolk whose ability then malfunctions. Does it ping the Mathematician?
A Yes.  Even though the ST is not a player, a player has an ability malfunctioning, and it was technically caused by the Plague Doctor player.

Q If the Ojo picks a character that is out of play, would that trigger the Mathematician's number?
A No. The consequences are part of her own ability,
  unless the character actually was in play but misregistered (Spy / Recluse) as an out of play character.

Q Does a poisoned Snake Charmer choosing the Demon cause a Mathematician ping?
A Depends on the source of the poisoning:
  * a self-poisoning SC means no ping, since the malfunction is not due to another character’s ability
  * another character poisoning the SC is a Mathematician ping
  
Q The Exorcist picks the Demon. Is this +1 for the Mathematician?
A If the Demon should be waking up to use their ability, and they are not because of the Exorcist,
  then the Demon ability has malfunctioned and it counts.

Q Does the Dreamer seeing a good role and a Minion role when checking a Legion player ping the Mathematician?
A Yes.  The Dreamer is not seeing the correct character, due to another character’s ability.

Q Does the No Dashii poisoned Sailor failing to drunk someone ping the Mathematician?
A Yes.

  While the Mathematician does not necessarily detect if a player is drunk or poisoned,
  she does detect any players whose abilities malfunction since the previous dawn due to those states.

Q Does the Demon's target being protected ping the Mathematician?
A Yes, the Demon's ability worked abnormally due to another character's ability, so that counts for the Mathematician.
  This includes when the ST picks the kill for the Demon (Yaggababble / Legion / Lil' Monsta / Ojo / ...).

=======
=Mayor=
=======
Q What happens when the evil Mayor (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter) convinces the town to not execute in final three?
A Evil wins.

Q Can the Mayor win still trigger after the Gangster kills one of their living neighbours?
A Yes, a Gangster kill is not an execution.

Q Does the Zombuul register as dead to the Mayor?
A Yes, meaning that if only the registering as dead Zombuul, the Mayor and one other player are left alive,
  then the Mayor win cannot happen as from the Mayor's perspective there are only two left alive.

  In order to trigger the Mayor win when the Zombuul is registering as dead,
  the town must not execute when the Mayor and two other players are left alive.

Q If the Demon kills the Mayor, can the Mayor bounce kill the sober Soldier?
A No, as the source of the bounced kill is still considered to be the Demon, not the Mayor, so the Soldier is safe.

Q Who wins in final three with the Mayor and the Vortox with no executions?
A The good team. Both abilities would trigger and since it is a tie between two character abilities good would win.

Q Can the protected Mayor (Tea Lady / Monk / Innkeeper) still bounce an attempted kill?
A No.  The Mayor's ability is "if you die". If they are protected, they cannot die so there can be no bounce.

============
=Mezepheles=
============
Q Can a good Mezepheles say the word and turn themselves evil?
A Yes, assuming they are the first good player to say the word.

Q Does the Preacher picking the Mezepheles turn the evil turned player good?
A No, the turned player stays evil.  But if the Mez is preached on the same night when a player would turn evil, then they have no ability and noone turns.

Q What happens if a good player says the Mezepheles’s secret word during N1,
  after the Mez’s point in the night order where they learn the word but before D1 starts?
A The good player turns on N2.

Q If the Mezepheles gets someone to say the word but they die by execution, does the person turn?
A No, because the Mezepheles' ability can no longer work in death.
  Note if the _target_ instead is dead, they can still turn.

Q Does the Sailor-drunk Mezepheles still turn a good player evil at night?
A If they are drunk at their spot in the night order, no. 
  If they were drunk when the word was said but sober at their place in the night order, yes.

Q Can the Mezepheles turn the Magician evil?
A Yes.  While the Mezepheles player thinks that the Magician player is the Demon,
  their Mezepheles ability registers the Magician as good,
  and therefore would turn them that night if they say the word.

==========
=Minstrel=
==========
Q Does a mid game Minstrel created (Damsel / Pit-Hag / Barber / Philosopher / ...) the night after a Minion execution immediately drunk everybody?
A No, the Minstrel ability must be in play when the Minion "dies by execution" (present tense), so coming into play after the fact has no effect.

Q If the public Goblin is executed while the Minstrel is in play, does the Minstrel immediately activate and block the Goblin's wincon?
A No, the Goblin win is triggered before the Minstrel can drunk them.

Q If it is a Minstrel day with the alive Scarlet Woman does the game end if the Demon is executed?
A Yes.

Q Does the Minstrel drunking also affect dead players for the purposes of situations like Vigor-killed Minions, the Plague Doctor ability, etc?
A The Minstel's ability reads "all other players (except Travellers)", so yes, dead players are still players.
  As per the ability text the only ones not hit are Travellers and the Minstrel themselves.
  Additionally, any Minion ability gained by the ST through the PD is not turned off as the ST is not a player.

======
=Monk=
======
Q Can the Demon still Barber swap a Monk protected player?
A Yes. Changing characters is not considered a harmful effect, and even if it was, the character changing is happening because of the Barber’s ability, not the Demon's.

Q Does a Vigormortis killed Minion lose their ability for the night if they are protected by the Monk?
A No; having an ability is not considered a harmful effect.

Q If a dead Monk-protected player is targeted by the Al-Hadikhia, can they be resurrected if they chose live?
A Yes, living and resurrections are not considered harmful.



Q Does the Monk protected, No Dashii poisoned, Minstrel proc after a Minion is executed?
A The Monk is not protecting the Minstrel when the Minion dies; the Monk only works during the night.
  The resulting No Dashii poisoned Minstrel does not proc.

---check this one:
Q The Monk protects the Pit-Hag holding Lil' Monsta.  Does the Monk block the PH from changing her character?
A No.  Changing characters is not considered a harmful effect so the Monk and Soldier cannot be protected from the Pit-Hag holding Lil' Monsta.

Q Does the Monk ability protect from positive Demon effects: regurgitating, resurrecting, etc.
A No, it specifically protects from harmful effects. Regurgitation and resurrection are not considered to be harmful.

Q Is a Monk protected Minion blocked from becoming the Imp when the Imp self-kills?
A No, becoming the Demon is not consider a harmful effect.

===========
=Moonchild=
===========
Q The Pukka picks the Moonchild N1.
  The Moonchild is executed D1 and, while poisoned, picks a good player.
  N2 the Pukka picks another player so the dead Moonchild is now healthy at their their turn in the night order.
  Does the good player die N2?
A Yes.
  As soon as a good player is picked by the Moonchild, they are marked to die, regardless of the status of the Moonchild.
  As long as the Moonchild is sober and healthy at their turn in the night order, the scheduled death happens.


Q When does the Moonchild need to be drunk or poisoned for their ability to fail?
A They would need to be drunk or poisoned at the time in the night order when their ability is resolved, potentially killing someone.

Q If the Moonchild dies and chooses the Demon who is the same night snake charmered, does the former Demon now poisoned Snake Charmer die?
A No. The ex Demon was evil at the time of the Moonchild pick, so no kill was "scheduled" to hit her that night.
  The Moonchild ability, at their turn in the night order, simply ignores her.

Q What happens if the Moonchild picks a player that later flips alignment (Goon due to their own ability / Mezepheles turned / ...) before the Moonchild's turn in the night order?
A If the player is good at the time of the Moonchild's pick
  then they are marked with the Moonchild's reminder token,
  and die at the Moonchild's spot in the night order,
  regardless of whether they have become evil.
  
  If the player was evil at the time of the pick and became good at night, such as when the Goon is flipped, then they do not die.


========
=Mutant=
========
Q Can the Mutant be executed for a madness break after they are dead?
A No, the dead Mutant has no ability.  Generally characters have no abilities when dead unless otherwise specified.

  This means:
  * they are free to claim Mutant now that they are dead,
  * they can no longer be punished if they had claimed to be an Outsider while alive and died from another cause.

Q Can the ST execute the drunk or poisoned Mutant for breaking madness?
A No, the Mutant ability to self execute would not work if they are drunk or poisoned.

Q What happens if the Philosopher with the Mutant ability claims to be the Philo-Mutant?
A Madness is always contextual, but if a player is claiming to be the Philosopher who chose the Mutant ability
  they are not claiming to be the Mutant, or an Outsider...
  unless this becomes a group's code for actually being the Mutant...
  which reiterates the point, that madness is entirely contextual.


===========
=No Dashii=
===========
Q Is a Townsfolk poisoned by the No Dashii still poisoned after they die?
A Yes.  The No Dashii does not care about living or dead status, only that the player is a Townsfolk.
  So any while dead or on death triggered ability will be poisoned.
  If the player ceases to be a Townsfolk then the poisoning must move.

Q Does the No Dashii still poison a neighbouring Townsfolk if they are evil (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter)?
A Yes, their ability does not care about alignment.

Q If a No Dashii poisoned Townsfolk gets protected by the Monk they become unpoisoned. Does the next neighbour then get poisoned?
A No. The No Dashii poison does not skip over safe players, it only skips over non-Townsfolk.
  So just the one Townsfolk on the other side of the No Dashii would be poisoned.

Q Does the No Dashii poisoning move if one of her Townsfolk neighbours becomes a non-Townsfolk, due to the Pit-Hag for example?
A Yes. It also moves if someone closer than their current Townsfolk neighbour becomes a Townsfolk.
  It is constantly checking for who is the closest Townsfolk to the No Dashii's left and right, and poisoning those two players.



=====
=Ojo=
=====
Q Does the Ojo picking the character that the Philosopher chose the ability of, cause the Philo do die?
A No.

Q If the Ojo targets the Village Idiot, do they all die or just one?
A Whenever there are multiples of a role in play, the Ojo kills one instance of them and it is the ST's choice.

Q What happens when the Ojo picks the Soldier?
A Nothing. The Soldier is targeted but cannot die so there are no Ojo deaths that night.

Q If the Ojo picks an out of play role, are kills arbitary, meaning there can be two kills,
  especially if there are multi-kill demons on the script?
A Sort of.
  The ST can choose any number of people to die to the Ojo,
  with or without a multi-kill Demon on the script,
  but deaths are not arbitrary so the ST cannot save people who die from other abilities.
  There can be mulitple kills or none but one kill is still the recommended number most of the time.
  
Q Can the ST choose to sink a missed Ojo kill?
A Yes.

Q If a character has died and in the night the Ojo names them, does the ST kill them again or kill someone else?
  Is there a rule or is it just up to the ST because is not that character technically in play?
A The character is in play, so it would target the dead player and there would be no death from the Ojo that night.

Q What are the ST's options if the Ojo targets the Recluse?
A The ST has several options:
  * If the Recluse registers as the Recluse then the Recluse dies. 
  * If the Recluse is drunk or poisoned at the time then they have no choice but to register as the Recluse.
  * If the Recluse registers as anything else then there is no Recluse in play as far as the Ojo is concerned and so the ST chooses kills.


===============
=Organ Grinder=
===============
Q The Organ Grinder is nominated but does not vote on herself, so the votes do not count.  Does this mean that any dead vote that was used is not spent?
A No, any ghost votes were still used and are removed at the end of the day.

Q The ST gains the Organ Grinder ability via the Plague Doctor in a non-Atheist game.
  As the ST cannot vote, does this mean that the good team cannot lose by executing the ST?
A Yes.

Q In an Organ Grinder game, where the OG is alive, healthy and sober, when exactly are the ghost votes taken away? 
A Ghost votes are removed at the end of the day, so after all nominations and votes have happened,
  not after every vote as it is typically conducted.
  This is so that players cannot tell where ghost votes were used.
  It is the players' responsibility not to vote twice until then.

Q What is the reasoning for the Organ Grinder/Minstrel and Organ Grinder/Preacher jinxes?
A Those abilities do not play well together.
  It is a hard confirmed Minstrel day after a Minion is executed if there is no death at night and then no need to close your eyes for the vote. 
  It is basically hard confirmed that the Preacher picked the Organ Grinder if one day there is no need to close your eyes when previously you had to,
  or if you started off not needing to and then suddenly you do because the Preacher died.

  Abilities are not meant to be that hard confirmable most of the time. It is unbalanced to the point of broken so they are simply not allowed to be in play together.
 
Q Does the Organ Grinder affect exile votes?
A No, exile "votes" are not votes.
﻿


=======
=Philo=
=======
Q What happens to the Philosopher Cannibal when the philo-drunk Cannibal is executed?
A Nothing.

  The Philosopher has the Cannibal ability so they eat the Cannibal, gaining the Cannibal ability.
  After the next execution, the Philosopher Cannibal gains a new ability.

Q If the dead Philosopher who has used their ability is resurrected, what happens?
A They are treated as a new instance of the Philosopher, with an unused Philosopher ability, and do not maintain any other previously gained ability.

  If the Philo died while they had an "even if dead" ability,
  then that ability was maintained while they were dead, then lost upon resurrection.
  Otherwise, any gained ability was lost when they died.

Q Does the Philosopher drunk the role or the player?
A The role.  If the player becomes another role (Pit-Hag / Barber swap / ...) then they become sober.

Q If the sober and healthy Philosopher chooses an info gathering Townsfolk ability and is later drunked or poisoned the same night, what happens?
A The Philosopher's once per game ability is used up.
  As they act before any poisoning and drunking roles they succeed in gaining the Townsfolk ability.
  While they are sober and healthy the respective Townsfolk is drunked.
  When they become drunked or poisoned, the respective Townsfolk is temporarily sober and their ability functions normally tonight.
  
  If the Philosopher had acted on later night while drunk or poisoned then they would not have gained the ability,
  and the ST would lie to them for as long as they were drunk or poisoned.

Q The Philosopher chooses an out of play role. Later the Pit-Hag creates this role. Does the player with the new role come into the game already drunk?
A Yes, the drunking is a constant check for if the character is in play.

Q If the Philosopher chooses Snake Charmer and becomes the Demon does the actual Snake Charmer becomes sober?
A Yes, and the former demon is now the self-poisoned Philosopher.

Q Could the Recluse not register as the Recluse so avoiding drunking by the Philosopher so that both the Recluse and the Philo-Recluse can both be working?
A Yes.

Q Can the Philosopher pick Philosopher and gain the ability of the Philosopher, turning them into the 'Philo-Philo', 
  effectively doing nothing other than creating a paradox on whether or not they get Philo-drunk?
A Yes, but that just results in a self drunking Philo.
  Droisoning paradoxes are mostly resolved as "everyone involved is droisoned".
  The ST could check in on the player in the morning and make sure they wanted to do that instead of trying to save their ability
  because they might have misunderstood the Philosopher.

Q If the Philosopher Poppy Grower is poisoned N1 what happens? 
A That depends on the source of the poisoning, as the Philo goes before roles like the Poisoner that choose.
  If the Poisoner chose the Philo it would not stop their ability, but the No Dashii would.
--  If the Philo PG is ever picked by the Poisoner the evil team do not learn each other, only in death can that happen.

Q What happens when the Philosopher tries to gain the ability of a character that is in a hate jinx with another already in play character?
A The ST should shake their head no, show the Philosopher the in play role that the ability is hard jinxed with and put them back to sleep.

  The ability is not gained and the Philosopher's once per game ability is now spent, but the trade off is they have learnt an in play role.
  For example, attempting to gain the Engineer role when Legion is in play will alert the Philosopher to it being a Legion game.

Q If the Philosopher dies before the character they chose does, does the Philo-drunkeness go away?
A Yes.

Q The poisoned Philosopher picks an each night role. 
  Do they ping the Chambermaid for each night that they wake up?
A Yes, they are waking for their own ability.

Q The Philosopher is poisoned or drunked on the night they use their ability.
  They become healthy the next night. Do they have the ability they chose by then?
A If the Philosopher is drunk or poisoned at the time they try to gain an ability, they fail to gain the ability and are a spent Philosopher with no ability.
  For as long as they remain drunk or poisoned, the ST should deceive them that they gained the ability by giving them arbitrary information when they would expect it.
  If they chose a mechanical ability, it will not work at all.
  But once they are sober and healthy again, the ST must stop the deception by treating them as a spent Philosopher that does not wake.

Q What happens when the Philosopher chooses Lunatic?
A The Lunatic is drunked but from their point of view there is no difference:
  * they still believe that they are the Demon,
  * the ST still takes their choices,
  * they can still fake Marionette/Lunatic/King/Exorcist info.
  
  The Demon:
  * learns the Philo as their Lunatic,
  * learns the Philo's picks for as long as the Philo is alive, sober and healthy,
  * has no idea who the Lunatic chose.
  
  The Philosopher:
  * gets to guide the Demon’s attacks, 
  * may cause the Lunatic to realise who they are due to their picks not dying.

=========
=Pit-Hag=
=========
Q If the Pit-Hag changes the Demon, is the Demon still asked to make a choice as to who to kill?
A ST choice. They do not have to, but they can.

Q Are the Pit-Hag's transformations reverted on their death?
A No.

Q Can the Pit-Hag create the character that the Philosopher picks the ability of?
A Yes, they are out of play.

  The Philosopher only gained the ability, they did not become the chosen role, so the Pit-Hag can successfully create the character.

Q Can the Pit-Hag create the characters that the Drunk and the Marionette believe themselves to be?
A Yes, they are out of play.

Q If the Pit-Hag creates a Demon but then loses their ability can an arbitrary deaths night still occur?
A Yes.  As soon as the Pit-Hag creates a Demon arbitrary deaths are global and cannot be removed.

  This covers:
  * the Vigormortis changing character causing the Pit-Hag to lose their ability
  * the Alchemist Assassin, whose ability cannot be blocked, killing the Pit-Hag
  * the Pit-Hag changing themselves to a Demon

Q After the Pit-Hag creates a demon and deaths are arbitrary, can the ST allow the Demon's kill to go through?
A Yes.

Q If the Pit-Hag changes another Minion to the Witch,
  then because the Witch comes before the Pit-Hag in the night order,
  does the new Witch wait until the following night to use their ability?
A Yes

  By the official strict night order ruling, that is correct.
  Some STs run it so that the Witch and the Cerenovus should get to act even if they were created that night, 
  and so long as the ST is consistent and sticks to the spirit of the night order, it is fine.
﻿
Q When do arbitary kills due to the Pit-Hag happen in the night order?
A The arbitrary deaths happen from during the Pit-Hag's turn in the night up to dawn.

Q When the Pit-Hag makes deaths arbitary, can the ST kill off players that are protected by the Innkeeper or the Lycanthrope?
A Yes, if the Innkeeper / the Lycanthrope is killed first.  Deaths may be arbitary, but protection still works.
  The Lycan's target can also be saved, as they pick after the PH acts.

Q The Gambler gambles wrong.  Later that night the Pit-Hag creates a Demon.  Can the Gambler survive because deaths are arbitary?
A No.

  The Gambler goes before PH in the night order and would be already dead by the time the Pit-Hag acts. 
  With the PH ability, the ST can only prevent subsequent deaths or cause new ones; they cannot resurrect the dead.

Q What happens if the Pit-Hag tries to create the evil Politician? Does it just fail, or do they learn they cannot do this and must choose again?
A The ST could remind the PH of the jinx if its a player they know is evil or they could choose to fail it otherwise.

Q Could the Pit-Hag turn the previous day's executee into the Barber or the Hatter and have their ability trigger?
A No. The Barber and the Hatter only trigger if they die, not if they are dead. 
  So if someone turned into Hatter or Barber after death, it does not trigger.
  Where abilities say 'when you die' or 'if you died' their triggers are on death.

Q Can the Pit-Hag make someone the Barber, then someone else the Barber after the first one gets Fang Gu jumped?
A If the Barber becomes the Fang Gu, then there is no Barber in play and it is valid for the Pit-Hag to make a new one.

Q Can the ST kill the Zombuul twice when there is a Pit-Hag Demon change?
A Yes.

Q If the Pit-Hag creates a Snitch, do the Minions immediately get extra bluffs?
A Not immediately, after kills and droisoning roles. Any starting info roles that enter the game on nights other than the first activate after kills and droisoning.

Q If the Pit-Hag changes somebody into the Drunk does the ST tell her that she got changed into a role?
A The Drunk ability reads "You think you are a Townsfolk but you are not", so the ST's options are:
  # tell her nothing, if she already thinks she is a Townsfolk, because she sees a Townsfolk token,
  # change her into a different Townsfolk, despite the fact that she is the Drunk.

Q Only one jinxed role can be in play so what happens if the Pit-Hag attempts to make a character that is hard jinxed by a currently in play character? 
  (e.g. trying to create the Spy/Widow while the Heretic is in play)
A The Pit-Hag attempting to make a character that is hard jinxed with an in play character would simply fail in the same way it would if the character was already in play.
  The Pit-Hag is not informed of the failure.
  But if they tried to create a Heretic, the ST should probably shake their head no, point at the jinx area of the character sheet,
  and wait for a valid choice, because the PH has tried to make an invalid choice by their own character's rules.

Q Can the Pit-Hag create the Damsel?
A Yes, but as per the Jinx the ST chooses who becomes the Damsel.

  All Minions, including the Pit-Hag, learn immediately the Damsel is in play if the Damsel player is alive.
  If an evil Damsel is created, the evil team loses if a Minion guesses them.

  If the Damsel comes into play after previously being in play, incorrectly guessed and removed, then the Minions get a fresh Damsel guess.

Q The Pit-Hag turns a good player into the Marionette. What does that player learn?
A The Marionette has to think that she is a good character, so if a Townsfolk or Outsider is changed into the Marionette,
  the ST has several options:

  # tell the now-Marionette nothing, as she already believes that she is a good character
  # tell the now-Marionette that she is the character she already thought she was
  # tell the now-Marionette that she is a different good character than what she previously believed

  The first option is the most common, essentially it turns a player into a Drunk, except the Demon also knows who she is.
  But the other two options are viable depending on the game state.

  The ST has a similiar decision if someone is made into the Drunk, except that they can only believe they are a Townsfolk, not an Outsider.

Q Can the Pit-Hag create the Atheist?
A Yes, and the good team wins if the Storyteller is executed.
  But the ST can now use their new game-breaking rules to do anything including turn the Atheist into any other character if they do not want to deal with it.

Q What happens if a good player is Pit-Hagged into an Evil Twin?
A There is now a good player whose character is the Evil Twin.
  This new ability of hers causes her to be paired with an evil player and they learn who each other are:
  * the good-aligned twin learns what character the evil player is,
  * the evil-aligned twin learns the good player is the Evil Twin.

  While both twins are alive, good cannot win., and if the good-aligned Evil Twin is executed, then evil wins.
  
  The most obvious choice for the evil player would be the Pit-Hag,
  but the Demon could be chosen or a dead player if the game is almost at the end and good do not have enough time to execute two people.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns the Demon into a non-Demon, what happens?
A If there is no living Demon,
  then barring some other effect that would prolong the game (Evil Twin),
  good would immediately win because "no living Demons" is good's win condition.

Q Can the Pit-Hag turn a dead player?  Is that not a waste of their ability?
A They can and there are reasons for doing so:
  * to turn an alive player into that role requires it being out of play first, such as removing a dead Assassin allows a new Assassin the next night;
  * they could be possibly revived or picked by another player that night;
  * turning someone into the Politician still allows them to turn;
  * turning someone into the Drunk when they expect to be Professor revived, can be awesome to cause confusion.

Q Could the Spy or the Recluse misregister as another role so appear to be out of play so allowing a Pit-Hag to create another?
A Yes.

=======
=Pixie=
=======
Q Can the Pixie created mid game be shown a Townsfolk turned evil (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter / Cult Leader / ...)?
A Yes; the only requirement for the Pixie is that they are shown an in play Townsfolk, who can be good or evil.

Q After a player dies, could the drunk or poisoned Pixie believe that they gained their ability?
A Yes, but if they ever become sober and healthy then they must be treated normally.

  If they believed that they gained an ability that wakes at night,
  they might become suspicious when they are no longer woken.
  So it might be best to only do this when the poisoning or drunking is permanent or long-lasting, for example when the Pixie is in fact the Drunk.

Q If the Pixie is shown the Village Idiot, does only one of the VIs need to die in order to turn the Pixie?
A During setup the ST will have marked one of the VIs with the Pixie reminder token - this is the VI that needs to die in order to turn the Pixie.
  The marked VI could the sober one or the drunk one, if there is one.

Q Could the Pixie get their ability just before being killed if their marked player dies during the same selection of a multi-kill Demon (Al-Hadikhia / Po / Shabaloth)?
A She could.  The order of the deaths would matter: if the marked player dies before the Pixie then she can gain her ability.

  For example, if the Ravenkeeper and the Pixie-Ravenkeeper both died in that order on the same night,
  then both could get their info.

Q If the Pixie is created late enough that there are no other Townsfolk alive, do they learn a dead in play Townsfolk and just never get the ability?
A The Pixie created mid game can be shown a dead in play Townsfolk and will likely never get their ability.  
 
  A late game Pixie is essentially just confirming an in play Townsfolk and should probably not be trying to gain their ability nor likely can they.
  
Q Can the Pixie learn themselves?
A Yes.

Q If no other player is a Townsfolk, does a Pixie just learn themselves?
A Yes.

Q If the Gambler dies to their own gamble, does the Pixie mad about the Gambler get to use that ability that night? 
A No, it is now past the Gambler's turn in the night order, as their death concludes their turn, so the Pixie-Gambler will act the next night instead.

Q Would the Pixie Artist be told "you do not have this ability" if they failed madness or the Artist did not die?
A Yes.

Q If the Pixie is made Cerenovus-mad about another character, does it break her initial Pixie madness?
A Generally, yes. If they are not Cere mad on a later day, they may still be able to bring it back around though.
  They can say "I was Cere mad yesterday, I am still the (madness target)".

Q The Slayer is killed by the Psychopath, and the Pixie-Slayer, if they had been mad enough, would immediately get the Slayer ability and be able to shoot the Demon, correct?
A Yes.

Q If the Pixie is drunk or poisoned at the moment their target dies, but is then sober and healthy that night, do they gain the ability?
A No, a droisoned Pixie cannot gain an ability. For as long as they are droisoned the ST can make them think they did though. 

Q What would happen if a character known to the Pixie becomes a different role, like a Farmer?
A That player still needs to die and the Pixie still needs to be mad as the character they were shown, and will receive the ability shown if sufficiently mad.

Q How does a Pixie who is N1 poisoned or drunk work?
A The Pixie still gains the ability they see if they are mad as that role, after the player marked with the Pixie mad token dies.
  
  They will likely be shown an out of play role, and an arbitrary player is marked, but probably best it is not the Demon.
  As long as the Pixie is mad about the shown role and the marked player dies, they still gain the role they saw.

Q What happens when the Pixie is affected by the Spy misregistering?
A The Spy is the marked player and they must die.  If the Pixie is sufficiently mad about being the role that they saw, they will gain the ability.
  Note:
  * The Spy could have misregistered as an in play role
  * The Spy registering as another character when executed makes no difference to the ability that the Pixie gains


===============
=Plague Doctor=
===============
Q What happens if the Plague Doctor dies multiple times?
A The ST gains multiple abilities.
  If all abilities are in play they can get an in play ability.
  That can happen if the PD is Barber swapped to a living player or a new one is made by the Pit-Hag.
  There is no way for the ST to lose an ability they gained.

Q Can the ST lose the ability granted by the Plague Doctor if the Minion comes into play or a player gains the ability (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Engineer / Alchemist)?
A No.

Q If the Plague Doctor gives the Baron ability, does the ST tell the players who changed roles?
A Yes.

Q What happens if all Minions on a script are in play when the Plague Doctor dies?
A Minion abilities can be duplicated:
  * The ST gains an in play Minion ability.
  * The Alchemist, if in the game, can change abilities and duplicate an in play Minion ability.


Q What makes the Pixie gaining an ability different from the ST gaining a Minion ability from the Plague Doctor?
  If the PD gave the ST an ability and is then swapped away, the ST keeps the ability, right?
A Pixie and PD are run differently.

  The PD dies and their reminder token is put on the side of the Grimoire indicating that the ST has gained an ability forever.
  At that point the ability the ST gains is independent from the PD ability.

  In contrast, the ability gained through the Pixie is a function of the Pixie ability and so intrinsically tied to it,
  same as the Philosopher who gains an ability loses it if they are switched to another character.

====
=Po=
====
Q Can a newly created Po (Engineer/ Pit-Hag / Hatter / Barber / ...) get a triple kill if as their last character they picked no one?
A No, their only choice is to kill no one or one player on their first night.  Choices or lack thereof as their previous character have no effect on their current character.

  For a triple kill, the Demon as the Po must actively choose no one to satisfy their ability.

Q If the Po charges, are they allowed to attack fewer than three people?
A No, the Po that chose to attack no one last time must now choose exactly three different players.

Q Does the sober and healthy Po get three kills if they charged the previous night while drunk or poisoned?
A Yes.

  The Po looks back at what it did the prior night; it does not matter whether they were drunk/poisoned or sober/healthy that night or not,
  their choice was still their choice.
  If their choice was no one last night, tonight they must choose three players.

Q The Po chooses to charge.  The next night the Exorcist picks the Po. The night after that, how many players does the Po select?
A Three.  The Exorcist effectively pauses the Po for one night and they triple kill the following night; the Po does not lose their charge.

  The Exorcist prevents Demons from making a pick the night that they are exorcised but does not change what the Po's last choice was.
  And when the Po's last active choice is no one, then the next night that they are able to wake they must choose three players.

  This differs from Courtier and Minstrel drunking where the Po can still choose to kill one person or none and it will be applied despite their drunkenness,
  and their kill (should they choose to kill) just will not work because they are drunk.

Q Can the Po pick someone three times?
  Or do they have to pick a dead person to disguise their kills as less kills?
A They must choose three unique people. If they want to sink kills, they have to choose the dead.

Q If the Po charges, is then Courtier drunked, do they retain the charge or is it expended?
A They must pick three players the following day but none of them will die, nor will anyone they choose in the next two nights 
  (as long as the Courtier lives and is not drunked or poisoned).
  Compare with if they charge while drunk and then become sober, then they must pick three players who do die.
  In summary:
   * At night: Charged
   * In between: Gets drunk
   * Following night: Chooses three in the night (none die)
   * Night after that: Gets to choose one kill or charge again

Q If the Po figures out that they are drunk, can they refuse to use their ability ?
  e.g. A Courtier drunked Po is woken and told to choose three players, but instead they shake their head.
A No, that is not allowed.

Q The Po charges then is switched to another player (Scarlet Woman / Hatter / Barber / Snake Charmer / ...). Do three kills still happen?
A No. It is a new instance of the character, so a reset of the ability.

============
=Politician=
============
Q If there is more than one healthy and sober Politican ability in play (Philosopher / Cannibal) can they all change alignment and win?
A No, only one can change alignment and win.
  They are now in competition as only one player can be most responsible for their team losing. 

Q Does the Politician work well in a Legion game?
A It is not that fun - the Politician is incentivised to vote on literally any execution but their own
  and be the single good vote Legion needs to pass every vote
  – it is difficult to claim they were not the most responsible for the good team's loss.

Q How does the Politician in a Revolutionary pair work?
A If the Politician is in a Revolutionary pair,
  it is the Politician who must be most responsible for the game end in order to potentially flip both players’ alignments,
  not the pair as a duo.

Q Can the Politician be Mezepheles turned, betray the evil team, and win with the good team?
A Yes.  The Politician is not restricted to only switching from good to evil at the end of the game, they can switch the other way too.

Q If the Pit-Hag turns himself into the Politician,
  could he campaign for his Demon's execution causing his team to lose, then flip alignment to win with the good team?
A No.  As per the jinx: the Pit-Hag cannot create an evil Politician.
  This prevents this exact scenario.

  The Pit-Hag role does not work great with alignment changers such as the Goon and the Cult Leader.

Q Can the Politician campaign for their own Fearmonger-execution and win with evil?
A Yes.

  The Politician flipping alignment does not change the result of the game;
  if they are Fearmonger-executed, the evil team's win is guaranteed.
  With the result decided, the ST must now consider if the Politician was most responsible for the good team losing.

  Arguably if the Politician successfully campaigns for their execution,
  perhaps after finding out that they were targeted,
  triggers the Fearmonger ability and causes the good team to lose,
  then the Politician should flip alignment and win with evil.

Q Can the Politician campaign for themselves to be the second good player execution in a Leviathan game and win with evil?
A Yes.

  The Politician flipping alignment does not change the result of the game;
  if they are the second execution of a good player then the evil team's win is guaranteed.
  With the result decided, if the ST then decides that the Politician was the main influence in causing their to team to lose,
  then the Politician can flip alignment and win with the evil team.

Q Can the Politician campaign for their execution on a Mastermind day and win with evil?
A Yes.

  The Politician flipping alignment does not change the result of the game;
  if they are the executed then the evil team's win is guaranteed.
  With the result decided, if the ST then decides that the Politician was the main influence in causing their to team to lose,
  then the Politician can flip alignment and win with the evil team.

Q How can the Politician win in an Atheist game?
A If the Politician successfully makes the entire good team believe that the Atheist is evil,
  and manages to get them to execute down to final 2,
  then they can be the only player that wins in an Atheist game.

Q How does it work if there is more than one Politician ability (Cannibal / Philosopher / Pixie / ...) in play?
A With multiple Politician abilities in play,
  there can be multiple players playing for the evil team.
  However, only the most responsible player can change teams, so they are in direct competition with one another.
  If any of these die while they have the Politician ability,
  they maintain the ability even if dead and can change alignments to win at the end of the game.

Q When does the Politician flip alignment in a Heretic game?
A The Politician’s changing of alignment is decided after the Heretic impacts the result of who actually won the game.

Q Can the Politician be the good twin to the Evil Twin?
A Yes, but don't; they will likely campaign for their own execution,
  never mentioning the twins,
  then win the game with evil as a result - it is pretty hard to argue they were not most responsible in that situation!

==============
=Poppy Grower=
==============
Q What is the Poppy Grower jinx with the Marionette?
A When the Poppy Grower dies, the Demon learns the Marionette but the Marionette learns nothing.

Q Does the Poppy Grower prevent the Demon from learning who the King and the Lunatic are?
A No.

Q Does the Demon learn the Marionette in a Poppy Grower game on N1?
A No, assuming a sober and healthy PG ability.

Q What happens if in a Poppy Grower game the Pit-Hag turns their Demon into a non-Demon?
A If there is no Demon in the game and nothing else to keep it going, such as the Evil Twin, then the game just ends with good winning.

Q Do evil Townsfolk or Outsiders (Bounty Hunter / Mezepheles / Cult Leader / Goon / ...) learn the evil team when the Poppy Grower dies?
A No, an evil Townsfolk / Outsider is not a Minion or a Demon.

Q If the Poppy Grower is swapped out of the game (Pit-Hag / Farmer / ...), do evil learn each other?
A No, the Poppy Grower must die for evil to learn each other.

Q What could cause the Poppy Grower in the game from the start to fail to prevent the evil team from learning each other?
A As the Poppy Grower acts early in the night, she would need to be poisoned or drunked on N1 from setup, via being:
  * sat next to the No Dashii
  * Puzzle Master drunk
  * the Drunk

  Other sources of drunking and poisoning act after the Poppy Grower so will not impact her ability.

Q What happens when the Lleech poisons the Poppy Grower?
A The PG is the poisoned host and unless evil can shift this (Pit-Hag makes a new demon / Barber swap / Hatter swap / ...)
  then evil will not be able to kill the PG without losing and so will never learn each other.

Q If the Snake Charmer succeeds in becoming the new Demon and the Poppy Grower later dies,
  will the evil team learn the old Demon or the new Demon?
A New Demon; the old Demon is no longer a Demon so would not be in any info.

Q If there is a dead Demon and a living Demon (Scarlet Woman / Fang Gu jump / Imp self-kill /...) what is shown if the Poppy Grower dies? 
A All Minions learn every Demon, and all Demons learn of every Minion, regardless of living status.

Q If the Poppy Grower is ever poisoned or drunked, do the evil team learn each other?
A Only if they _start_ the game poisoned by being sat next to the No Dashii or start drunk due to the Puzzle Master.
  After N1,
  droisoning benefits the good team
  because it deactivates the second part of the Poppy Grower's ability, 
  meaning that if the Poppy Grower dies while droisoned,
  the evil team never learns each other.

Q If the Poppy Grower dies while drunk or poisoned, evil do not learn each other, correct?
A Correct.

------------------------------combine
Q Does the Pixie or the Cannibal gaining the Poppy Grower ability prevent evil learning each other when the PG dies?
A Yes. They get their ability immediately upon the PG's death, meaning there is no "gap" between the two abilities wherein evil would be able to learn each other.

Q If the Pixie sees the Poppy Grower and has been sufficiently mad then when the PG dies do evil still learn each other or would the Pixie Poppy Grower hold it off for longer?
A The Pixie-PG would hold it off. Double PG abilities through Philo, Cannibal, or Pixie require them both to die sober/healthy in order for evil to learn each other.

Q If the Philosopher Poppy Grower dies while the Poppy Grower is alive, sober and healthy do the evil team learn each other as the ability says "if you die, they learn who you are"?
A No, because there is an active PG ability still in play.
--------------------------------------

-------------------------combine
Q If the Demon kills the Poppy Grower at night, when does the evil team learn each other?
A As soon as possible.

Q If the Poppy Grower dies to the Demon at night (past the Poppy Grower's night order), does the evil team have to wait until the next night to learn their teammates?
A The evil team learn each other at the first opportunity after the PG dies. 
  If she is executed, that is the start of the night; if she dies at night, it is immediately after that death.
---------------------------

Q What happens when the Cannibal-Poppy Grower is the last living instance of the Poppy Grower ability
  but they lose their ability not when they die but when someone else is executed?
A Evil will never learn each other.

Q According to the jinx, the Spy / the Widow do not see the Grimoire until the Poppy Grower dies.  What if there is a Cannibal Poppy Grower in the game?
A They see the Grimoire when the last Poppy Grower ability (Cannibal / Pixie / Philosopher / ...) dies.

==========
=Preacher=
==========
Q Can the Preacher preach the ST if the Plague Doctor is on the script?
A No.  Also the ST is not a Minion so would not lose the ability anyway.

Q If a preached Minion becomes another Minion (Engineer / Hatter / Pit-Hag / ...) do they lose their preached status?
A No, a preached Minion remains preached so long as they are a Minion.
  They do not get to use their new Minion ability while the Preacher is alive, sober and healthy.

  If they are switched to a non-Minion they would no longer be preached, then could become an unpreached Minion with an ability again.
  That is, until the Preacher picks them again.

Q Can the ST gain the ability of a preached Minion when the Plague Doctor dies?
A No, the ability may not be functioning at the moment but it is still in play.

Q Does a preached Minion who dies and is then resurrected by the Al-Hadikhia regain their ability?
A No, they did not stop being a Minion when they died, and they are still preached provided the Preacher is still alive.
  (the Preacher's reminder token would still be next to them in the grim)
  
  In contrast, resurrecting the Preacher does not cause Minions to lose their ability again;
  as a fresh instance of the Preacher they must start their preaching over
  (when the Preacher originally died the ST would have removed their reminder tokens from the grim).

Q Does the Preacher dying giving the Minions a new instance of their ability or not?
  eg, an Assassin is preached after killing, the Preacher dies, can the Assassin kill again, or is re-activation simply just, as it was before.
A No,  this is not a new instance of the ability; their ability is simply reactivating.

Q The Preacher and Vigormortis interactions:
  # The Preacher chooses a Vigor killed Minion: the dead Minion loses their ability, the neighbouring Townsfolk is still poisoned.
  # The Preacher chooses a Minion who is then Vigor killed: the Minion is dead, poisons their neighbour, no ability.
  # either of the above then the Preacher dies: the Minion regains their ability.
A  All correct.

Q If the Preacher selects a Minion (say Devil's Advocate) and the Demon kills the Preacher the same night, should the DA's ability work that night?
A No.  The DA is woken before the Demon kills so the DA must wait to the following night to use their ability.

Q If a Preacher targeted Minion later becomes a different Minion (Barber / Hatter / Pit-Hag / ...), are they still preached and without an ability?
A Yes.  As long as they are an uninterrupted Minion, even if they change Minion type, they would still be preached. This is similar to Vigormortis in that sense.

===========combine
Q If the Plague Doctor gives a Minion a second ability, what happens when the Preacher preaches them?
A The Minion cannot use either ability while the Plague Doctor is alive, sober or healthy.

  The Preacher states that chosen Minions have no ability, so they lose both their native ability and the ability they gained from the Plague Doctor.
  The Preacher's ability is also stated in the present tense, so it is an ongoing effect,
  meaning that if a Minion is preached and then given an ability by the Plague Doctor, 
  they are still preached and still have no ability.

Q If a preached Minion gain another Minion ability from the Plague Doctor, is that ability also suppressed?
A Yes.  They would still gain the second ability, but both abilities are suppressed while the Preacher is alive, healthy or sober.
======================

Q If a preached Minion becomes a different character type, say a Demon, and then becomes a Minion again, will they still be preached?
A No.  The moment they stop being a Minion, the preached effect ends on them and does not ever return unless the Preacher chooses them again when they turn back.

===========
=Professor=
===========
Q Can the Professor resurrect a Townsfolk turned evil (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter / ...)?
A Yes.

Q If there are three people alive going into night, Demon kills one of them (two people alive), and then the Professor resurrects one (three people alive), does Evil win?
A Evil won the moment there were only two people alive, which was immediately after the Demon chose a kill.
  The Professor does not get to act that night because the game was over already.

Q If there are no dead players, do you wake the Professor and tell them that?
A You would wake the Professor, prompt them to use their ability,
  and they would presumably shake their head and go back to sleep,
  or they might try to choose the player that they think died tonight (to no avail, because no one is dead)
  and you would put them back to sleep after a couple times trying,
  to prevent them from fishing.
  Telling them that no one is dead at their point in the night order is giving them too much information.
  Waking them is also important to roles such as the Chambermaid.

Q If the Professor picks an alive player, is their ability spent?
A No, the ST shakes their head to say that they should pick again,
  however if they’re just trying to see if others are dead or living, you should just put them to sleep.
  
Q If the Professor attempts to use their ability on a dead player when drunk/poisoned, is their once per game ability used up?
A Yes.

Q If someone is resurrected before the Professor wakes, and if the Professor tries to resurrect them (thinking they are still dead), is the Professor's ability lost?
A No as it would still be an invalid target. The ST should shake their head and prompt the player to pick again.


============
=Psychopath=
============
Q If a player is bluffing as the Psychopath and is executed, can they pretend to play roshambo with their nominator?
A No, they are not the Psychopath so do not have the ability that allows them to play roshambo.

Q If the Psychopath is protected by the Devil's Advocate do they still play roshambo /
  Does the Alchemist Psychopath protected by the Tea Lady or Pacifist still play roshambo?
A Yes, and then it is only if they lose and do not die that the good team discovers they were protected.

Q When can the Psychopath choose to kill someone?
A Each day before nominations begin.  They could kill as soon as the day starts if they wished.
  The Psychopath should not be allowed to interrupt an action such as the ST privately giving a player any information.

Q If the Psychopath self nominates, who do they play roshambo with?
A The ST.

Q If the poisoned Psychopath is executed, do they play roshambo and die whatever the result? Or do they die without playing?
A They just die without playing; mechanical effects do not happen while poisoned.

---
Q If the Alchemist Cerenovus chooses the Psychopath, and the Psychopath player breaks madness by choosing to kill the Alchemist, what happens? 
A The ST can choose to execute the Psychopath before the kill goes through or not.
  The Psychopath does not cause an instantaneous kill, as she must first publicly claim the ability and then choose a player,
  and could be executed mid sentence.
  If the ST does execute for the madness break then the Psychopath and ST will play roshambo to see if the Psychopath dies.

Q If the Psychopath is executed for breaking Cerenovus madness who do they play roshambo against? 
A The ST.  From the how-to-run:
  "If the Psychopath nominates themselves or would be executed for another non-nomination reason
  (Cerenovus madness break, for example) the ST plays roshambo with the Psychopath." 
⁠-------------

Q How do the Psychopath and the Vigormortis interact?
A The Psychopath keeps their ability if killed by the Vigormortis.
  So they can still name a player before nominations to die, and if their corpse is executed,
  they play roshambo with the person who nominated them.
  There is no reason to nominate their body though since they are already dead and cannot die again, but it would be amusing.

Q The Vizier forces the execution of the Psychopath. Do they play romshambo?
A The Psychopath and their nominator will play roshambo.

Q If the Psychopath who never claimed to be the Psychopath is executed, do they still play roshambo?
A Yes, with whomever nominated them.

Q If the Psychopath never claims that they are the Psychopath and are nominated, are they announced?
A No, the ST does not directly state that they are the Psychopath.
  If they are executed then they play roshambo with their whomever nominated them, so it will be pretty obvious what they are.

Q The drunk Psychopath cannot kill anyone, correct?
A Correct. Drunk or poisoned characters do not actually have abilities.

=======
=Pukka=
=======
Q If the Pukka passes to another player (Hatter / Scarlet Woman / Barber / ...), is the previously poisoned player still poisoned and scheduled to die?
A No. As a new instance of the Pukka, the ability resets, so their victim immediately becomes healthy.

Q If the Pukka dies and the game continues (Evil Twin / Mastermind / ...) does the previously poisoned player still die?
A No, killing the Pukka completely removes their ability from play: the victim immediately becomes healthy and does not die.

  In contrast, drunking the Pukka keeps the poison in play, killing the player when the Pukka sobers.
  
Q What happens when the Pukka chooses while drunk or poisoned?
A If the Pukka is drunk or poisoned when they pick at night then:
  # the player who already has the poisoned token is temporarily healthy (some STs choose not to remove the token entirely to help them remember; some turn it upside down) 
  # no new token is placed down.

  On the next night when the Pukka is both sober and healthy:
  # the Pukka's choice will now cause a new poisoned token to be placed down.
  # the previously poisoned player is re-poisoned, they die, then become healthy

Q If the Pukka is drunked (Courtier / Goon / ...) when does the previously poisoned player die?
A When the Pukka becomes sober.  Until then the previously poisoned player is temporarily healthy, which the ST can indicate by turning the poison reminder token upside-down.

Q If the Pukka becomes another Demon (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Engineer / ...), what happens to the previously poisoned player?
A They are immediately no longer poisoned and will not die tonight.
  
Q What happens when the Pukka kills a character with an ability that acts on death (Sweetheart / Barber / Plague Doctor / Hatter / Farmer / Ravenkeeper / Sage / ...)?
A Their ability does not trigger.

  The Pukka's kills always die poisoned.
  This is what allows the Pukka to kill characters such as the Sailor or the Fool who might otherwise survive thanks to their own ability.

  But dying poisoned also means that effects which trigger upon death malfunction meaning for example that:
  * the Pukka is not offered the Barber swap when the Barber dies
  * a good player is not drunked when the Sweetheart dies
  * the ST does not get an out of play Minion ability when the Plague Doctor dies
  * the evil players do not get to switch their roles when the Hatter dies
  * the evil team do not learn each other when the Poppy Grower dies
  
  But while those were all bad for team evil, consider:
  * the Farmer does not create another Farmer
  * the Sage can be told two non Demon players
  * the Ravenkeeper may be given false info

Q If the Pukka is chosen by the Exorcist does the previously poisoned player still die?
A Yes.  The effect of the exorcism is to delay the Pukka's next kill.

  The Exorcist only stops the Demon to wake to use their ability,
  but any other part of their ability still works.

  In this case, the Exorcist causes the Pukka to not wake to choose a player, 
  but she does not need to wake for the previously poisoned person to die then become healthy; that is a separate part of the ability.

  The next night, the Pukka wakes as normal to poison a player and no one dies as the previously poisoned player is already dead.

Q Can the Pukka poisoned Fool die even if she has yet to use her ability?
A If the Fool is poisoned, then she does not have her ability, so she will die the first time she is killed.
  The same goes for the Sailor.

Q If the Lycanthrope picks a good player but is then Pukka poisoned that night, can there be a Pukka kill tonight?
A Yes, the Lycanthrope pick and the previous night's Pukka pick since the Lycanthrope protection is now poisoned.

Q In order to not die to the Pukka, does a player need to be Monk protected the night they are picked by the Pukka or the following night when they would die?
A Either:
  * If they are protected the first night then the Pukka poison is never applied, so there is no "previously poisoned player" the following night, so no Demon kill.
  * If instead they are protected the following night then they do not die and become healthy.

  The Pukka's target does not need to be protected on both nights: if they were protected on the first night, then the Monk is free to protect someone else the following night.
  From the Monk's perspective they have two good targets available to them, the player targeted the night before or the one targeted tonight - the Monk is super strong in a Pukka game.

Q If the Monk-protected player is picked by the Pukka, are they poisoned that night?
A No (the ST does not place the Pukka poison token next to them), and they do not die the following night.

Q If the Monk-protected player is picked by the Pukka, do they still die the next night?
A No, nor are they Pukka poisoned the night they are picked.

Q If the Monk protects a player who was Pukka poisoned on the previous night, even though that player was the "previously poisoned player", they will not die tonight, right?
A Correct.  The player does not die and becomes healthy.

Q N1 player X is Pukka poisoned. N2 the Monk protects player X but is then later targetted by the Pukka. What happens to player X?
A They die.

  Player X is no longer poisoned while Monk protected, but when the Monk becomes poisoned, the protection is removed.
  As player X is still the previously poisoned player, they die.

Q If the Monk-protected player is picked by the Pukka, they are not poisoned and do not die the next night, but does the Pukka's previous pick still die tonight?
A Yes.

Q What happens when the Pukka picks herself?
A Nothing good for the Pukka:
  * As soon as she picks herself she is permanently poisoned for the rest of the game, so she cannot kill anyone, including herself.
  * The previously poisoned player, if there is one, is immediately healthy, and does not die.
  * If she somehow became healthy on a later night then, as the previously poisoned player, she would die.

Q The Pukka's pick is poisoned and the following night dies and then becomes healthy.
  If that player does not die because of protection (Monk / Tea Lady / Innkeeper) do they still become healthy?
A Yes.  The player's dying and becoming healthy are two separate events, one does not rely on the other; if anything prevents them from dying, they still become healthy.

==============
=Puzzlemaster=
==============
Q If the Puzzlemaster becomes a different character, is their drunkeness removed from game?
A Yes.

Q If the Puzzlemaster's target changes character, is that player still drunk?
A Yes.  For as long as the Puzzlemaster is in the game and healthy and sober, the picked player is drunk, even if that player changes character.

Q Could the Puzzlemaster drunk a role in a hate jinx pair, allowing the other role to enter play?
A No. Hate jinxes are a part of setup whereas the Puzzlemaster has no setup ability; the puzzledrunk player is decided after tokens have been distributed.
  So pairs of hate jinxed characters still cannot be placed in the token bag in a Puzzlemaster game.

  On the other hand, if one of the hate jinxed pair is _the_ Drunk then both roles can be put in the token bag, as then only one of the roles is techically in play.

Q When does the Puzzlemaster guess?
A During the day.

Q If a character is drunk because of the Puzzlemaster, are their setup abilities in effect?
A Yes.

  The reminder token is placed on N1,
  after tokens are sent out and [setup abilities] have already resolved,
  so that is when the drunking starts.

Q If a dead player is Pit-Hagged into the Puzzlemaster, is a player made Puzzlemaster-drunk?
A No.
  Their ability reads "1 player is drunk, even if you die", rather than "even if you are dead",
  so the Puzzlemaster does not start making someone drunk if they enter play while already dead.
  The Puzzlemaster must be alive to drunk a player and when they die continue to drunk that player,
  which prevents Puzzlemasters from just getting themselves killed early to stop making their teammates drunk.

Q Does the Puzzlemaster that guessed wrong in a Vortox game gets the correct Demon?
A No. Puzzlemaster is an Outsider and is therefore not affected by Vortox.

Q If the Puzzlemaster guesses their drunk player in a Legion game, what happens?
A They are given any one Legion, ST's choice.
  It should also be a living Legion, as the ability says "the Demon" and when there are multiple Demons in the game,
  that means living Demons who are "the" Demon (while both living and dead Demons are "a Demon").

Q If the Puzzlemaster guesses their drunk player on a Mastermind day with no Demon alive, what happens?
A If all the Demons are dead then the ST chooses one of the dead Demons.

Q If the Puzzlemaster guesses their drunk player and there is no Demon in the game,
  after the Demon was pit-hagged out of the game with an Evil Twin in play,
  what happens?
A The ST will tell them no one.

Q If the Puzzlemaster is droisoned, is the puzzle-drunk player still puzzle-drunk?
A If the Puzzlemaster is drunked / poisoned, their ability does not work,
  so the person they have made drunk is temporarily sober (the ST can indicate this by turning the Puzzlemaster drunk reminder token upside down)

Q If the Puzzlemaster is created mid game, does the ST immediately make someone puzzle-drunk?
A Yes.

=========
=Recluse=
=========
Q Could the Recluse misregister as a Minion or a Demon if picked by the Courtier to avoid being drunked?
A Yes, but don't.

Q Can the Recluse register as evil at the end of the game and win with evil?
A No.

Q Can the Recluse registering as the Demon learn the King?
A Yes, but don't.

Q Can the Recluse, registering as a Minion, successfully guess the Damsel?
A Yes, ending the game.

  They could also learn the Damsel is in play if they register as a Minion at any time,
  but it is generally not the point of Outsiders that they can be hard-confirmed to other players, so do not do this.

Q When the Snake Charmer swaps with the Recluse, there are no alignment changes,
  so after telling the Recluse that they are now the Snake Charmer, are they told that they are good?
A No, players are only informed of their alignment after it changes.
  If they ask the next day then the ST can explain that they are only informed of aligment when it changes,
  so they can probably work out that they are still good from this.
  
  They will not know for sure if they changed character because of the Pit-Hag / Snake Charmer / Barber / ...

Q Is it legal to show the Recluse to the Demon as a Minion?
A Yes, but don’t.  That would be an Outsider ability hurting evil.

Q Can the Recluse register as a good Minion/Demon?
A Yes.

Q If the Recluse dies, could they misregister as a Demon and trigger the Scarlet Woman? What would the SW become?
A They could, but probably should not.

  The SW's ability explicitly says "you become the Demon."
  They would become whatever Demon the ST registers the Recluse as, but never a Recluse.

Q Can the Recluse be told that there is a Damsel?
A Yes but don't.

Q If the Recluse is picked by the Snake Charmer, could the SC become the Demon?
A Yes.
  "Each night, choose an alive player: a chosen Demon swaps characters and alignments with you and is then poisoned."
  So if the Recluse registers as the Demon the swap happens,
  with the Snake Charmer becoming the Recluse or whatever Demon is on the script that the ST thinks the Recluse is registering as,
  and the Recluse becoming a self-poisoned Snake Charmer.

Q Could the Imp with no living Minions starpass to the Recluse?
A Technically, yes; however, this makes the Recluse into the good Imp, meaning that they need only to get themselves killed in order to win.
  So it is not recommended for the Imp to do this.

Q Can the Recluse register as the Spy and trigger a Virgin?
A No.

  The Recluse only registers as the Spy, but does not gain the Spy ability, therefore cannot register as a Townsfolk.
  
  Think of registering as: if an ability "asks" a player about their character or alignment or living status, they can "answer" with something other than what they are.
  Misregistering can never change the game directly (like executing someone).
  It can however trick someone else's ability into doing it for them,
  like the Spy who nominates the Virgin - the Spy's ability cannot kill themselves, but it can trick the Virgin's ability into thinking they are a Townsfolk,
  after which the Virgin's real ability can execute them.

Q If the Recluse is in play, the Scarlet Woman is on the script and the Zombuul is executed, can the Recluse register as the Scarlet Woman and become a good Zombuul?
A No, they do not actually have the Scarlet Woman's ability.
  If the Recluse dies the Scarlet Woman can become the Demon however.

Q If the Snake Charmer is turned into the Recluse (Pit-Hag / Barber / ...), 
  is the ST allowed to show the former SC "you are now the evil Pukka" using the Recluse's register as a Demon ability?
A No.

  The ST is not allowed to lie to the player about their character or alignment unless the ability allows for that specifically (like Lunatic, for example).
  The Recluse does not believe they are anything else; they always know that they are the Recluse.

  The ST could never falsely tell the Recluse they are evil, a Minion, or a Demon.
  The Recluse's ability of possibly registering as evil does not allow them to believe that they are the Demon.
  This is opposed to the wording on the Drunk or Lunatic which specifically say they believe they are something else.

===============
=Revolutionary=
===============
Q Can a Traveller and a non-Traveller sat together be a Revolutionary pair, assuming both are present at the start of the game?
A Yes.

Q What happens if an alignment changing ablity (Snake Charmer / Mezepheles / ...) targets a player in a Revolutionary pair?
A This is a matter of ST judgement: it either has no effect and both players stay their prior alignment, or both players change to the new alignment.

Q Can the Bounty Hunter turn a Townsfolk player who is in a Revolutionary pair?
A Revolutionary pairs are decided at setup, the same time as the Bounty Hunter evil Townsfolk.
  As such, if the two players in the pair are good, then neither of them can become the Bounty Hunter evil Townsfolk.
  However, the ST could pair the evil Townsfolk with a Minion or the Demon.

Q Can the Bounty Hunter incorrectly learn a good player in a Revolutionary pair who registers falsely?
A Yes.

Q Could the Revolutionary cause the Damsel to register falsely as another character when guessed by a Minion?
A Yes but don't.

Q Could the Revolutionary cause a good player to register falsely as a Minion when they accuse someone of being the Damsel?
A Yes but don't.

Q How does a Revolutionary pair work if the first half draws the Lunatic?
A The other person is given any good character.  The Lunatic player will probably figure it out immediately.

======
=Riot=
======
Q What is the Hatter jinx with Riot?
A If the Hatter dies in a Riot game, and a Riot chooses a different Demon, a normal evil team is created from the Riot players.

  If the Hatter dies and the Demon chooses Riot, the Minions become Riot too.

------------------reword
Q Can there be a call to exile a Traveller while there is a Riot active?
A No, the call should be made before nominations open.

  In a Riot game calling for the exile of a Traveller does not kill them immediately;
  Riot only affects nominations, so a Traveller exile vote should be run as normal.
  There should be no interruptions once a Riot nomination train is rolling, so all calls for Traveller exiles should occur before nominations open.

Q If a Townsfolk nominates the Virgin in a Riot game, which ability takes priority?
A If the Virgin is nominated by a Townsfolk in a Riot game,
  the Virgin dies and the Townsfolk is immediately executed, ending the day.

  If it is day three, the game ends and the evil team wins. 
  After all, it is the Virgin's job to ask Townsfolk to not nominate her, or do it before day three.

Q Can each Riot be told different bluffs, or do all of them have to receive the same three?
A ST choice.
  When there are multiple Demons (like Legion), if the ST wants, each Demon can receive different bluffs.

Q The Golem nominates a Riot player who does not die.  Does the Riot player get to nominate?
A Based on how Soldier is explained, players who do not die do not have to nominate but can.

Q The Golem is alive in a Riot game and has already used their nomination.  What happens on D3 if they are nominated?
A The Riot ability forces them to nominate again.  There is no issue with them being the Golem as they would be already dead at that point and have no ability.

  It is while the Golem is alive that their ability would prevent them from killing a Riot player.

Q In a Riot game, is there an extra Minion in play, for example four total evil in a 12 player game?
  Lil' Monsta specifically says there is +1 minion, but Riot does not specify this.
A There is no +1 Minion, because the Demon is already Riot, so there is the usual number of evil players who are all are Riot.

  The Lil' Monsta adds +1 Minion because the Monsta token does not actually go into the bag; the extra Minion is dealt so that there are the correct number of evil players.
  In the case of Riot, the correct number of evil tokens go into the bag because the ST adds that many Riot tokens, so there is no need to add an extra Minion.
  
  Just to clarify:
  * there are not supposed to be Minions in Riot games; the problem for good is that every starting evil player is a Demon, so they need to get rid of every evil player to win.
  * no player is the Lil' Monsta; the Minions choose a babysitter for the Lil' Monsta each night, making that player count as the Demon for all game mechanics that care.

======
=Sage=
======
Q Would the Sage wake up if they are killed by a nomination from the Demon?
A No, unless it is a Riot game because of the jinx.

Q Does a Mayor bounce to the Sage register as a Demon kill?
A Yes. 

  The Demon is still the source of the attack and the ST would place the Demon's dead token.

========
=Sailor=
========
Q Does a new instance of the Sailor created mid game (Damsel / Pit-Hag / Barber / Philosopher / Cannibal / ...) get to drink with someone the night that they are created?
A Philosopher Sailor and Cannibal Sailor sure, otherwise no, because it would already be past the Sailor's turn in the night order.
  Not drinking means that they cannot die that night or the following day.

Q Can the Gossip kill the Sailor?
A Only if the Sailor is drunk or poisoned, otherwise the Sailor cannot die by any means except to the Assassin.

=======
=Saint=
=======
Q If the Philosoper Saint nominates the unspent Virgin, do good lose?
A Yes.

========
=Savant=
========
Q Can the Recluse register good in the first part of Savant info, and then register evil in the second part, or do they have to register the same in both parts of the Savant info?
A If you are running with misregistration in Savant info (which there is some contention about)
  then yes, the Recluse (and even the Spy) can register differently to two parts of a single ability.

Q Can the poisoned Savant receive two true statements?
A Yes, assuming no Vortox is in play. 

===========
=Scapegoat=
===========
Q Not that you should, but can the Scapegoat save the good Evil Twin or the Saint from being executed?
A Yes.

===============
=Scarlet Woman=
===============
Q If the Demon is executed in final five, does the Scarlet Woman become the new Demon?
A Yes, as it needs to be five alive at the time of the Demon's execution for the Scarlet Woman ability to trigger.

Q Can the Demon who was the Scarlet Woman guess the Damsel?
A No, they are no longer a Minion.

Q What is the Al-Hadikhia jinx with the Scarlet Woman?
A If there are two living Al-Hadikhias, the Scarlet Woman Al-Hadikhia becomes the Scarlet Woman again.

  This means that if the Scarlet Woman turned Al-Hadikhia resurrects the Al-Hadikhia,
  they revert to being the Scarlet Woman rather than staying the Demon themselves as well.

Q There are five players left alive including the Imp and the Scarlet Woman.  The Imp is executed, leaving four alive.
  Does the SW activate?
A Yes.

Q If the Slayer slays the Imp, but the Scarlet Woman is in play, what happens?
A Assuming none of these players are poisoned or drunk, in Trouble Brewing, if there are five or more players when the Slayer slays the Imp,
  the Imp dies and the Scarlet Woman will immediately become the Imp,
  The former SW should be informed at the next available opportunity the following night that they are now the Imp, before getting their kill.

Q In a Poppy Grower game, the Psychopath kills the Demon and then, later that same day, the Slayer chooses the Scarlet Woman. Does the SW die?
A Yes. The SW became the Demon even before they were informed.
  The SW's ability takes over the Demonhood immediately upon the Demon's death.
  If they did not, then the game would technically be over in the space between the Demon's death and the night phase.

Q If the Scarlet Woman becomes the Demon during the middle of the day (due to the Slayer, the Witch, ...), when are they informed?
  Should they ask?
  Do they have to wait until the SW's turn at night?
A Wait until the start of the next night phase.
  The SW's position in the night order is really just a reminder in case the ST forgots to inform them of the demonhood after the Demon died during the day.
  So if you get to that point and realize you have not yet, no big deal.
  
  Trigger based abilities are meant to happen the moment they trigger, 
  with any relevant things that may need to be done, or info given, at the first reasonable opportunity,
  often the start of the night. 
  The night order for trigger abilities should be considered flexible.

Q If the Scarlet Woman catches the demonhood, but is then instantly Snake Charmed,
 would they learn who the King, Marionette and Lunatic are?
A Yes, the SW is woken to learn of those characters before the Snake Charmer acts.

===========
=Shabaloth=
===========
Q The Shabaloth dies and the game continues (Scarlet Woman / Mastermind / Evil Twin / ...).  The dead Shabaloth’s kills can no longer be regurgitated, correct?
A Correct, as the Shabaloth who picked them no longer has an ability, so cannot regurgitate anyone.

Q If the Shabaloth picks two player while drunk / poisoned they do not die that night, but if one of the is executed the next day, could they be regurgitated the following night?
A Yes.

Q What if four players go to night with the Shabaloth alive? Does the Shabaloth killing two players happens at the same time as the revival of a previously killed player?
  Or when four players go into the night with the Shabaloth in play is it effectively the end of the game?
A Regurgitation, if the ST chooses to do it, happens before the Shabaloth's killls, so there would be five alive then two would die, and the game can continue.

Q Can the Shabaloth choose to regurgitate people?
A The Shabaloth does not control whether someone is regurgitated; that choice falls to the Storyteller.

Q Can the Shabaloth pick the same player twice?
A Not on the same night, since that would still only amount to one player being chosen.
  The clause "choose two players” is not equal to "choose a player, then make that same choice again”.
  It specifically requires two unique players to be chosen in order to satisfy.

Q Could the Scarlet Woman who becomes the new Shabaloth resurrect the old Shab?
A The ST should never use the Shab's ability to resurrect another demon.

Q Does the Shabaloth regurgitate before or after they kill?
A Before.

Q Does the Shabaloth get shown who is regurgitated that night before she picks her next two kills?
A No, the Shabaloth is not told anything about regurgitations.
  The ST makes the decision on regurgitation before the Shabaloth wakes, 
  (i.e. before the kills)
  then wakes the Shab and have her point to two players.
  Any deaths and resurrections are announced at the start of the day, and the players update the Town Square accordingly.


Q How exactly does the Shabaloth work? When does regurgitation happen?
A If the Shabaloth chose two people the night before, then just before they attack tonight, one of those people they chose, if they are currently dead, may come back to life.
  Note that if the Shabaloth is chosen by an Exorcist and does not wake to attack anyone tonight, they can still bring one of their previous night's targets back to life 
  because regurgitation is not tied to their waking up. 

  Note that the Shabaloth's previous targets do not need to have been killed by the Shabaloth's attack in order to be revived,
  they only need to be dead on the next night.
  This means that the Shabaloth can choose someone who is already dead and revive them the next night,
  or the Shabaloth's target can survive the attack,
  then die the next day and subsequently be revived because they are now dead in time.


========
=Slayer=
========
Q When is the last moment a character can activate their ability? 
  Should the Slayer be allowed to use their ability after the day's execution has been carried out?
A Any time before they die, and before the day officially ends.
  So after they are on the block but before they are actually executed is fine.
  Most STs also allow a few seconds for day abilities between the execution and officially declaring the day over and night beginning,
  but that might vary by ST, so players should clarify what is allowable before relying on that window.
  Most would not allow the Slayer their shot after their execution as they are dead.

Q If the Slayer kills the Demon will there still be nominations that day?
A If the game ends, then there will be no nominations.
  If the game continues, say due to a Scarlet Woman, nominations continue as normal.

Q Can the Slayer shoot mid vote?
A Yes, but the ST might want to finish resolving the vote first and the player may have repeat their target in case the ST did not hear it or forgot.
  The ST may not be inclined to let the Slayer kill or clear someone in the middle of the vote,
  so the Slayer might want to do it before, so that there is no need to vote, or after, to convince town to lift.
  
===============
=Snake Charmer=
===============
Q The evil Snake Charmer charms a good Demon, swapping roles. Do they still swap alignments?
A Yes.

Q If the Snake Charmer charms the Demon, do they receive any bluffs?
A No.

Q What happens when the Cannibal Snake Charmer picks the Demon?
A The Cannibal becomes an evil Demon and the Demon becomes a good poisoned Cannibal. 
  The Demon is not told that they are poisoned but will deduce that they Cannibal SC picked them.

Q If the dead self-poisoning Snake Charmer is resurrected (Professor / Al-Hadikhia) are they now healthy?
A Yes, as they are treated as a new instance of the character.

Q If the Snake Charmer and the Demon swap, does the new Demon learn who the Minions are?
A No, unless the Poppy Grower is killed after that.

Q Can the ST show a poisoned Snake Charmer that she turned into the evil Demon?
A Yes, but it is not recommended.  
  The ST can even give a fake Lunatic, tell her the next night that she killed the Poppy Grower, ...

Q If the Snake Charmer chooses a dead demon, does she become the Demon?
A The Snake Charmer must choose alive players.

Q The Snake Charmer picks the Pukka.  Does the old Pukka's pick from the previous night get nullified so there are no deaths this night?
A Yes.

Q What is the difference between the Demon being picked by the Snake Charmer and the Philosopher Snake Charmer?
A In the first case the Demon becomes a self-poisoned Snake Charmer,
  while in the second case she becomes a self-poisoned Philosopher.

Q What happens if the Snake Charmer hits the Lleech?
A The ST needs to shuffle a lot of tokens:
  # The Snake Charmer becomes the new Lleech.
  # The ex-Lleech becomes the poisoned Snake Charmer.
  # The previous host is no longer poisoned or a host, so the host token is removed.
  # The new Lleech, just as if it was N1, gets to pick a new host.
  
Q Does the new Demon wake and kill after a Snake Charmer swap?
A Yes, assuming their Demon character wakes that night, since they are after the SC on the night order. 

Q The Philosopher picks Snake Charmer, philo-drunking the original SC, and then chooses the Demon.
  So the starting Philo is now the evil Demon and the starting Demon is now the poisoned good Philo.
  What happens when the original no longer Philo-drunk Snake Charmer chooses this new demon?
A In the case of a Snake Charmer and a Philosopher with the Snake Charmer ability both in play, 
  the ST decides who acts first, which is important for this question.

  If the Philosopher-SC acts first and becomes the Demon, 
  then the old Demon becomes a poisoned Philosopher and the actual SC becomes sober
  (Why would the original Snake Charmer become sober? 
   Because the Philo causing them to be drunk is no longer in play; we have a new instance of the Philo)
  Now the Snake Charmer can also choose the new Demon (the game's starting Philo) and swap to the Demon
  ... giving the possibility of one player (the OG Philosopher) going from good Philo to evil Demon to good self poisoned SC.
  What happens to the OG demon (who became the self poisioned Philo)?
  The original Demon would still be the self poisoned Philosopher, the second snake charming would not change that.

  Depending on the kind of game the ST likes to run and the group of players would like to experience, 
  generally it would be recommended to have the Philo-drunk Snake Charmer choose first to prevent this overload of shenanigans.

========
=Snitch=
========

Q Can the Minions learn evil characters via the Snitch?
A Yes, if the ST wants that. The Snitch's text does not specify "good characters”. 

Q How does the Marionette jinx with the Snitch work?
A The Marionette is not woken to learn three out of play characters.
  Instead the Demon is shown an additional three instead, 
  with additional meaning just that: the Demon must see three more different characters.
  But, Snitch bluffs do not have to be good roles;
  useful if the ST think the Demon is good as is,
  or is running out of tokens for a full game.

=========
=Soldier=
=========
Q Does the Soldier who is safe from the Demon still die when they are stabbed by the Assassin holding Lil' Monsta?
A Yes.  Their death does seem consistent with the Assassin's ability.

Q Minions killed by the Vigormortis poison a Townsfolk neighbour.  Is the Soldier safe from this poisoning?
A Yes, as it is a Demon ability that causes the poisoning.

Q Can the sober Soldier die during the night in a Lil' Monsta game?
A Not to the Lil' Monsta or the babysitter, as the source of the kill is still the Demon even when the ST picks the target.
  It is possible for the Soldier to die to non Demon sources.

Q Can the soldier die in a Legion game?
A Not to Legion, as a Legion player counts as both a Demon and a Minion, and the source of the kill is still a Legion player even when the ST picks the target.

Q Is the Soldier safe from the Demon using the Barber swap on them?
A No.

Q If the Soldier is sitting next to the No Dashii, they are not poisoned since they are safe from the Demon.
  However if they are ever drunked or poisoned from another source (Poisoner / Sailor / ...), they get No Dashii poisoned.
  Once the drunking or poisoning wears off, is the Soldier still No Dashii poisoned?
A Yes.

Q The Soldier is safe from the No Dashii's poison, but is she also safe from the Pukka poison and the subsequent kill?
A Yes, and she is also immune to the Lleech's poison, but is still the host, just an unpoisoned host.

Q The Soldier is safe from the No Dashii poison.  Does the poisoning pass through the Soldier to the next Townsfolk?
A No, the No Dashii only ever skips non-Townsfolk players. If the neighbouring Townsfolk player is immune in some way, like the Soldier, then the poisoning simply stops and has no effect.

=====
=Spy=
=====
Q Can the Spy be poisoned by the No Dashii?
A No.  The poisoning would sort of loop: 
  # The Spy who neighbours the No Dashii and misregisters as a Townsfolk becomes poisoned.
  # Being poisoned, the Spy can no longer register as a Townsfolk.
  # The No Dashii poisoning must move to the next neighbour as the current target is not a Townsfolk so no longer valid.
  # The Spy is no longer poisoned and regains their ability.

  But the ST is free to repeatedly move the poison from the Spy to the next Townsfolk and back, to their own delight for as long as they want.

Q Can the Spy registering as good become the Farmer?
A Yes.

Q Can the Spy register as not a Minion and stay as the Spy despite an attempted Engineer swap?
A Yes.

Q If the Ojo or the Courtier chose the Spy, could the Spy misregister to avoid being chosen?
A Yes.

Q If the Ojo targets a Townsfolk can the attack be redirected to the Spy registering as same?
A Yes but don't.

  The Spy misregistering as a good character can cause her:
  * to die instead when the Ojo targets any good character.
  * to survive if the Ojo targets the Spy, causing an Ojo miss so the ST picks the kill(s).

  But note:
  * if the Spy does register as the intended target there is still only one death, so the ST could not kill off both the actual target and the Spy.
  * the Spy could still register as the Spy and be killed by the Ojo.

  This logic also works with the Recluse:
  * picking any evil character can kill the Recluse instead
  * picking the Recluse can have the Recluse misregister and therefore survive

Q If the Spy is drunk / poisoned, does she still get to view the grimoire or does she get to view a fake version of the grimoire?
A The ST could show the drunk / poisoned Spy any version of the Grimoire that they wished:
  * the correct one, 
  * something totally wild,
  * the Grimoire with just one or two small changes to throw off what the Spy thinks the gamestate is.

  Since showing her the correct grimoire works against the idea of the Spy malfunctioning,
  and showing her a wildly inaccurate grimoire tips her off that she is getting bad info, 
  the simpler approach is just to show her that different people are malfunctioning,
  then watch her report that the Mayor or the Slayer is powerless, and then surprise!

Q When showing the (healthy and sober) Spy the Grimoire,
  can the ST replace a (healthy and sober) Recluse's token with any Minion or Demon token, 
  and/or the Spy's own token with any Townsfolk or Outsider token?
  For example, could you replace the Spy's own token with the Drunk token for funs and giggles?
A Yes, and it is used sometimes, for example, to show what the Spy was seen as to the Washerwoman or the Librarian.

Q When the Spy sees the Grimoire, is it just the roles or also the reminder tokens used?
A It is whatever the ST has in the Grimoire at the time really.
  They can remove the reminder tokens if they want, but most STs leave them in.

Q Can the Spy be the Red Herring?
A Yes, though it is kinda sneaky. The Spy can also start registering as evil at some point, causing the RH to move to another good player (even sneakier).
  Use caution.

Q Could nominating the Spy who is registering as the Virgin cause the nominator to be executed?
A No. Registering as something does not give that player the ability.

Q Can the Spy register as the Damsel and then the Recluse be told that the Damsel is in play?
A No. The Spy registering as a role does not gain that role's ability.

Q Can the sober and healthy Slayer hit the Spy, who registeres as the Recluse, which then registers as the Demon?
A No. Registering as something does not give the player that ability.
  So the Spy registering as the Recluse cannot then register through the Recluse's ability, since they do not have it.

---------------reword
Q If the Spy is juggled twice, once as the Spy and once as the Juggler, can the Juggler receive a two, or can the Spy only register as one character for the whole ability?
A 0, 1 and 2 are all valid numbers for that juggle. 
  Comparing with the Spy/Chef interaction, getting a two is valid.
  But, just because an ST could give a two, does not mean that she should.

Q If the Spy is preached and later dies, do they get the misregistration part of their ability back after the Preacher dies?
A Yes.

Q Can the Town Crier can get a no if the Spy nominates?
A Yes.

-------------reword me
Q Is it okay to show the Washerwoman an out of play Townsfolk and point to the Spy and one other player?
A It is legal to do that with the Washerwoman and Librarian, and show no real Minions to the Investigator using the Recluse.
  This could be a good move for the ST when there is not a lot of other misinformation in play, for instance, no Drunk and no Poisoner.

=========
=Steward=
=========
Q What happens if the Steward's good player becomes evil later?
A Nothing. The Steward is a start knowing ability, not a constantly knows.

===============
=Storm Catcher=
===============
Q If the player favoured by the Storm Catcher is turned evil (Mezepheles) what happens?
A They are still storm caught meaning they can only die by execution.

Q If the Boomdandy explodes, can the player favoured by the Storm Catcher die?
A No.  However, the Storm Catcher can be removed from play immediately before the Boomdandy execution and kill the previously storm caught character at will.

Q The Storm Catcher favours the Damsel ...?
A Do not storm catch the Damsel!

Q Do newly created evil players, such as the Demon jumping, learn the player favoured by the Storm Catcher?
A Yes.

Q Does the Marionette learn the player favoured by the Storm Catcher?
A It would probably be best not to, as otherwise that would tell the Marionette that they are evil.
  Good players do not learn about storm caught players, and the Marionette thinks they are good, so that kind of works.

============
=Sweetheart=
============
Q Does an evil player who becomes the Sweetheart still drunk another player when they die?
A Yes.

Q The Sweetheart dies and drunks a player.  Does the player sober if they ever change character?
A No.  The Sweetheart drunkness is on the player, not the character, so the new character enters play drunk.
  To stop the drunking would require the Sweetheart to be swapped.

Q If a dead player becomes the Sweetheart (Pit-Hag / Barber swap / ...) is another player Sweetheart drunked for the rest of the game?
A No. 

  The Sweetheart's ability is a trigger on death, not a constant check of living status, as it states "when you die" not "whilst you are dead", so:
  * a player with the Sweetheart ability dies: another player is instantly drunked for the rest of the game
  * a dead player becomes the Sweetheart: no drunking happens.

Q If the Sweetheart is resurrected (Al-Hadikhia) or swapped to a living player, so that there is now a living Sweetheart in the game, 
  does the player that they previously drunked become sober?
A Yes.

  Resurrected and swapped roles are treated as new instances of the role, so as a new instance of the Sweetheart, any drunking by the previous instance ceases.
  If the new instance dies, then a player is drunked again.

==========
=Tea Lady=
==========
Q Can either of the Tea Lady's good neighbours die to the Moon Child?
A No.

  If both of the Tea Lady's neighbours are good then they cannot die to any ability except the Assassin's.

Q What happens if the Tea Lady has two good neighbours and a multi-kill demon (Shabaloth / Po / ...) attacks the Tea Lady and one or both of her neighbours?
  Does her protection go away when she is attacked or does it last that night until dawn?
A As soon as the Tea Lady dies, the protection disappears.
  The Demon's choice order matters though. If the protected TL neighbour is chosen first and then the TL is chosen, only the TL dies.
  But if the TL is chosen first, the protection is gone and the neighbour will also die.

------------combine?
Q If the Tea Lady's neighbours are a two good players, one of whom is a Traveller, can that Traveller be exiled?
A No, exile is death and the Tea Lady protects their neighbours from dying. The Traveller can leave the game, though.

Q Does the Tea Lady ability ignore neighbouring Travellers?
A No.

Q Can the Tea Lady protect a Traveller from exile?
A Yes. Exiles are death, and the Tea Lady protects her neighbours from death.
---------------------

========
=Tinker=
========
Q Can the Tinker die by execution if they are protected, for example by a Tea Lady?
A No.

Q Can the Tinker die in the day due to their power?
A Yes, as long as they are able to die and are not protected by another ability.
  But although you can, but you probably should not.

  It is legal for the ST to kill the Tinker at the start of the day when night deaths are announced, to hide the fact that they died during the day.
  In BMR that can give the Godfather a kill or frame an Assassin kill if they were Innkept.

Q Suppose the Tinker cannot die at night due to Innkeeper protection,
  but the ST kills them immediately at dawn to make the town think they died at night.
  Is the ST obligated to specify whether or not they died "at night", which is something a lot of STs do?
A RAW the ST can wait a fraction of a second after announcing night deaths and then say the Tinker died,
  There is no need to specify if it was a night death or not.

============
=Town Crier=
============
Q If the Town Crier is dead during the day and resurrected the next night (Al-Hadikhia / Professor / ...),
  are they told if a Minion nominated the previous day?
A Yes.

==========
=Toymaker=
==========
Q Does the Demon get bluffs in a Teensyville game? 
A No.  Also the evil team does not learn each other.

  Unless it is a Teensyville script using the Toymaker Fabled character, 
  which gives evil players their usual information but the Demon must skip attacking one night.
﻿
Q Does the Po choosing to charge satisfy the Toymaker's requirement that the Demon must choose not to attack at least once per game?
A Yes.

Q Does the Poppy Grower ability still prevent the evil team learning each other in a small game with the Toymaker Fabled in play?
A Yes.


============
=Undertaker=
============
Q If the Undertaker is resurrected at night (Al-Hadikhia / Professor / ...) does she learn the most recent executee, even if she was dead at the time of their execution?
A Yes.

Q Does the Undertaker learn the role of an executed player that does not die? 
A No.

  The Undertaker's ability reads "you learn which character died by execution today" so the execution must cause the player to die.
  So executing dead players or protected players means the Undertaker receives no info.

Q In a Riot game, does the Undertaker learn about all the execution in the day?
A The ST chooses one of the executees for the UT to learn about, not all of them.

Q If a player is executed then swaps character (Pit-Hag / Barber / Engineer / Hatter)
  what does the Undertaker see?
A They learn the player's role at the time of the execution.

  The Undertaker's ability is past tense: they learn what character was executed, not what character that player currently is.
 
Q The poisoned Recluse is executed, but is not poisoned when the UT's turn comes up in the night, what happens?
A The UT must see the Recluse.
  The UT evaluates the character not at the time that they wake but when the character died.
  So the ST has to take the answer at the moment of execution, which would have to be Recluse.

Q A player is executed and dies. Another dead player then breaks madness (Mutant / Cerenovus / Harpy). 
  Can the second player be executed for madness breaking and shown to the Undertaker?
A No, the UT learns which character died by execution. If one player is already dead, the UT can only learn the one who died by execution, not either.

Q The Imp is executed, the Scarlet Woman kills the Hatter, and the former Imp becomes the Spy.  Could the Undertaker learn Fortune Teller?
A No, they must see Imp.  The Undertaker learns their character at the time of their execution, not what character that player currently is.

Q If the Recluse is executed, what does the Undertaker see?
A The Undertaker can see the Recluse as any of the Minions, the Imp or just the Recluse.

  The Undertaker can see the wrong role because roles like the Recluse and the Spy can misregister to other characters even when dead.
  
Q If the Drunk is executed, what does the Undertaker see?
A The Undertaker is shown the Drunk character token, not the token for the Townsfolk that the Drunk player thought they were.

Q If the Spy is executed, what does the Spy see?
A The Spy's ability allows her to register as good, even after death, so she could register to the Undertaker as the Spy, or as any Townsfolk or Outsider.



=============
=Vigormortis=
=============
Q What is the effect of the Vigormortis killing their Marionette?
A Besides one of their closest Townsfolk neighbours being poisoned from now on, 
  the Marionette retains their ability,
  but since this is a "you think are a good character" and killed good characters do not normally wake in the night,
  the ST should probably stop waking them.

Q Does the Vigormortis-killed Scarlet Woman become the dead Demon if the Vigor dies with 5+ alive?
A Yes, which could end the game.  Vigormortis and SW are not a great pairing.

Q If a living Minion gains another out of play Minion ability via the Plague Doctor,
  do they keep this second ability if killed by the Vigormortis?
A Yes.

Q If the Vigormortis-killed Poisoner poisons the Vigormortis, does the Vigor kill that night?
A No.

Q Does an evil Apprentice killed by the Vigormortis retain their ability?
A No, they are not a Minion.

Q If the Vigormortis is changed to another Demon (Pit-Hag / Engineer / Hatter),
  what happens to Minions they previously killed?
A They lose their abilities and neighbouring Townsfolk are no longer poisoned.

Q If a Vigormortis killed Minion changes role (Pit-Hag / Engineer/ Hatter)
  does the Minion keep their ability?
A A Vigor killed Minion keeps their ability and continues to poison a neighbouring Townsfolk as long as they always remain a Minion.

  If they ever stop being a Minion, they lose their ability and stop poisoning a neighbour, even if they later become a Minion again.


Q The Vigor kills their Pit-Hag. The dead Pit-Hag changes the Vigormortis to another Demon.
  Does the PH lose his ability due to the Vigormortis being no longer in play?
A Yes.  Additionally the ST still has a momentary ability to kill arbitrarily, so should probably signal the Demon change,
  because after that moment passes, the Pit-Hag's ability is gone again, so deaths are not arbitrary anymore. 

Q Would a Vigormortis-killed Pit-Hag that turns themself into a Townsfolk/Outsider fail to gain that ability?
A They would become that role and then no longer have an ability.

  "Minions you kill keep their ability" means that if the person killed by Vigor is not a Minion, or stops being one, they lose their ability.
  Notably, a Vigor-killed Minion can be changed into a different Minion character and continue to use that ability, because it is still a Minion ability.
  But once they become something that is not a Minion, their ability is gone, even if they later become a Minion again.

Q The Vigormortis kills the Recluse who poisons their neighboring Townsfolk.  Does the poison wear off if the Recluse is ever poisoned or drunk?
A Yes.  A drunk or poisoned Recluse cannot register as a Minion to the Vigormortis so the poisoning must stop.

Q Could the Recluse misregister as a Minion when she is killed by the Vigormortis in order to poison a Townsfolk neighbour?
A Yes, this is completely legal.
  Also the ST could at any point choose to register the Recluse as a Demon or the Recluse to the Vigor, ending the poisoning.

  Arguably Outsiders should always be used to hinder the good team, but the ST might need to consider game balance when making decisions.

Q If the Vigormortis changes places (Snake Charmer / Barber / Hatter ...) does a Minion they have killed keep her ability and continue to poison her neighbour,
  or do dead Minions need to be rekilled by the new Vigormortis?
A Character swaps essentially reset the characters; they are replaced with new instances of the characters.
  In this case the Vigormortis that was giving dead Minions their abilities no longer exists, so those Minions lose their abilities and their neighbours become healthy.

  A new Vigormortis cannot "reactivate" their dead Minions' abilities by attacking their corpses, 
  because attacking an already dead player does not "kill" them.

Q What happens if a Vigormortis-poisoned Townsfolk becomes a different character type (Pit-Hag / Barber) or 
  a neighbouring player being skipped by the poison becomes a Townsfolk?
A The target is no longer valid, so the poison must move to a new Townsfolk neighbour of the Vigor-killed Minion.
  This can still be in either direction from said Minion; reapply the poison to either of the closest Townsfolk neighbours.

Q A Vigormortis killed Minion keeps her power and poisons one of her neighbours.
  Could a second kill, by another character or by execution, of that Minion disable her ability and the poisoning?
A A second kill would have no effect on the Minion: a dead player cannot be killed, they are already dead.

Q Does the Vigormortis-killed Alchemist keep her ability?
A No, she is not a Minion. The Alchemist has a Minion ability but is not actually one.

Q The Barber was killed by the Vigor, and swapped with the Evil Twin. Does the dead Evil Twin keep their ability? 
A No.
  A player must be a Minion at the time of the kill and remain a Minion the entire time for Vigor to work.
  It is okay to be swapped or pithagged into a different Minion, as long as they are never not a Minion inbetween.
 
  If a player died as the Barber, as in the example, they do not ever get to keep a Minion ability even if they become one later.

Q If the Vigormortis passes to the Scarlet Woman, do previously killed Minions keep their abilities?
A No. It is a new instance of the Vigor and this Vigor is not the one who killed those Minions.

Q If the Vigormortis becomes drunk, like say, from the Minstrel, do Minions they have killed regain their ability when made sober?
A Yes. It is a present-tense effect, so it is always in effect whenever the Vigor is sober and healthy.
﻿
Q Killing the Evil Twin as the Vigormortis loses the unwinnable condition,
 because the text says 'Good cannot win if you both live.' 
 However, if the Good Twin is executed while the Evil Twin has their ability because of the Vigormortis, does evil win?
A Yes.

===============
=Village Idiot=
===============
Q If the Drunk believes that they are the Village Idiot, how many real Village Idiots can be put in the game?
A There are only three Village Idiot tokens in the game, so if one of them is the Drunk,
  practically speaking there can only be two other Village Idiots, with one of them being drunk from their own ability.

Q If a player gains the Village Idiot ability (Philosopher / Cannibal / Pixie) could they be drunked by their own VI ability, gaining wrong info?
A No, the drunking due to the VI ability is a setup effect.
  Also, gaining the VI ability does not make a player the VI, and the drunking specifically targets a VI.
  So, the info from the the gained VI ability must be sober, unless they are targeted by another drunking or poisoning ability or the ST house rules gained VI abilites otherwise.

Q If the drunk Village Idiot changes roles, do they become sober making one of the other VIs drunk?
A They become sober because they are no longer an extra Village Idiot.
  They do not make another VI drunk because the drunkeness is a setup effect and cannot affect the middle of the game.

Q Can one of the Village Idiots be the Marionette?
A Sure, if they neighbour the Demon or the Recluse.
  If this leaves one true VI in play then that one must be sober.
  If it leaves two, one of them is drunk and the other one is sober.
  The Marionette VI is then run like any other Marionette.

  In order to guarantee the Marionette Village Idiot, an alternative setup of some sort is needed,
  such as substituting the Demon token in the bag with an extra Townsfolk, 
  then on N1 picking a Townsfolk neighbour of a VI to become the Demon.


========
=Virgin=
========
Q Could an evil Townsfolk (Bounty Hunter / Mezepheles / Cult Leader / ...) trigger the Virgin?
A Yes.  An evil Virgin can be triggered too!

Q What happens when the Virgin is first time nominated by a Townsfolk protected by the Tea Lady?
A The ST announces that the Townsfolk player is executed but does not die and starts the next night phase.

Q If a good Traveller nominates the Virgin will they be executed by the Virgin's ability?
A No. The Virgin only cares if it is specifically a Townsfolk. Alignment does not matter.
  A Traveller is not a Townsfolk, so no matter their alignment it will not work. It will still waste the Virgin's ability though. 

Q Is there another way that Townsfolk A nominates another player X and A becomes executed immediately, except X is a Virgin? 
  i.e. are there any situations for X to simulate the Virgin?
A i) Atheist game.
  ii) Breaking Cerenovus madness or Mutant madness while nominating could mimic that style of execution.

Q What happens when the first time the Virgin is nominated, it is done by a Witch-cursed Townsfolk?
A ST choice:
  # the nominator is executed and dies by the Virgin ability.
  # the nominator dies to the Witch curse, then their corpse is executed by the Virgin ability. The ST announces "X dies and is executed".
  
  In both cases the day will be over (barring the Butcher being in play). The first option hides the existence of the Witch, which depending on game state might be better for evil,
  but the second option makes the Witch a little stronger:
  * The Undertaker (who only learns about those who die to execution) would not be woken that night.
  * The Cannibal will not gain the ability of the nominator.

========
=Vizier=
========
Q The Vizier's ability reads "All players know who you are." Is the droisoned Vizier announced on the first day? Or can the ST make the Vizier believe they are sober/healthy by still announcing them?
A The Vizier remains unannounced (and cannot force through an execution and can die during the day) until they become healthy/sober.  
  
  Droisoned players can never affect the state of the game,
  even if that means they immediately realize they are droisoned.
  Maintaining the illusion for that one player is less important than maintaining the basic principle that droisoned players have no ability
  and therefore cannot affect the state of the game.
  So, the ST may lie to a player that their ability is working but may not lie to the town as a whole that a player’s ability is working.

Q If the Vizier is the Lleech host, are they unkillable?
A No. They are poisoned and have no ability.

Q If the Vizier is under madness and breaks the madness, is he executed?
A You can execute them as the ST, but they would not die. It is probably a bad idea to as it just wastes a day for the good team with no counterplay.

Q If the Vizier forces the execution of the Lleech who obviously does not die, will there more be executions that day or not?
A No, you have one execution per day and an execution will always immediately end the day (unless there is a Butcher)
  and there are never more executions after the first.

  A player can be executed without dying, and there are some abiltiies that work interestingly around this concept.
  It is why the Mutant's execution instantly ends the day or why Cannibal specifies "recently killed executee" rather than just "executee".

Q If the Vizier is D1 drunk, does that drunkness mean that the Vizier does not have to be announced? Should it be announced N2?
A Yes, and it would be announced the first time they are sober/healthy, same as the King.
  The how-to specifies the Vizier announcement is during the day,
  so RAW it is possible a Poisoner or other sources of droison could keep a lock on the announcement for a few days - similar to Leviathan
  but that is pretty risky if the Viz gets executed while evil is strategically holding off their announcement.

Q The Golem can kill the Organ Grinder but not the Vizier, correct?
A Correct. The Vizier cannot die during the day for any means, unless droisened.

Q Can the droisoned Vizier die to execution?
A Yes.

========
=Vortox=
========
:Alchemist in a Vortox game
Q Does a sober and healthy Alchemist always have correct waking patterns in a Vortox game?
A They are told the ability of an in play Minion but are treated like the ability they actually have,
  which would be the ability of an out of play Minion. So they have the wake pattern of their actual ability.

Q What does the Alchemist Evil Twin learn in a Vortox game?
A Loads!

  Firstly she is told wrongly that she has a different Minion ability, one that is actually in play.
  Next she learns the wrong role of another good player as her evil-aligned twin,
  which will likely alert her to the fact that she has the Evil Twin ability.

  So she learns:
  * one of the in play Minions,
  * a confirmed good player,
  * the Demon is a Vortox.

Q What does the Alchemist, a Townsfolk role, learn in a Vortox game? / Is the Alchemist immune from the Vortox?
A The Alchemist, although they have a Minion ability, is still a Townsfolk and is not immune to the Vortox.
  The Alchemist learns an in play Minion, but has the ability of an out of play Minion,
  as the Vortox causes misinformation but does not change the ability's working.

  For example, in a game with the Witch and the Poisoner in play and the Harpy and the Devil's Advocate on the script,
  the Alchemist learns that they have the ability of the Poisoner while in reality they have the DA's ability. 
  The ST still has to maintain the DA's restriction on not picking the same player twice in a row. 

Q Would an Alchemist with the Spy or the Widow ability see an incorrect grimoire in a Vortox game?
A The Alchemist cannot have the Spy or the Widow ability as they are jinxed combinations. 

Q In a Vortox game, the Alchemist has a passive Scarlet Woman ability, but thinks she has the Poisoner ability. Should she be woken every night?
A No.
  It is not the same as a 'you think' like the Drunk or the Marionette who are constantly lied to.
  She should just got false information at the start,
  so N1 she is told an incorrect ability but then treated like she would be for her actual ability.

Q In a Vortox game, the Alchemist is told that they have the Godfather's ability (an information gathering Minion),
  when in reality they have a different Minion ability (say some passive Minion like Boomdandy or Scarlet Woman).
  What do they learn regarding Outsiders?
A The Alchemist is just told that they have the Godfather ability, but then nothing else because they do not actually have the Godfather ability.

Q In a Vortox game, what does the Alchemist Godfather learn?
A She falsely learns that she has a different Minion ability, that is in play.  She is then shown out of play Outsiders.
-------------------------------

Q Does the Philosopher Puzzlemaster guessing incorrectly learn the Vortox?
A No, as guessing wrong already yields false info so does not need to be changed; the Vortox forces false info not flipped info.

Q Does a good player still learn the non self-poisoning Widow in a Vortox game?
A Yes. The Vortox only affects Townsfolk abilities and the ping comes from the Widow, which is a Minion.

Q Are Townsfolk with a non-Townsfolk ability affected by the Vortox?
A Yes.

Q Is the Duchess affected by the Vortox?
A No. The Vortox affects Townsfolk abilities. The info source, the Duchess, is a Fabled so unaffected by the Vortox, even if it is a Townsfolk receiving the information.

Q Can the Lunatic learn true info in a Vortox game, this Minion is a Minion, the King is the King, ... ?
A Yes, the Lunatic as an Outsider is unaffected by the Vortox falsifying of info. It is up to the ST whether this is a good idea.

Q What could the drunk Savant be told in a Vortox game?
A Drunking and poisoning has no effect on the info received in a Vortox game; the Vortox forces all info to be false.
  _The_ Drunk who believes that they are the Savant is unaffected by the Vortox due to being an Outsider, so their statements can be
 both true, both false or one true and one false.

Q Does the Monk protected player receive true info in a Vortox game?
A Yes. They are safe from the Demon in all aspects, including secondary effects, assuming they are sober and healthy.

Q Who must the Monk protect for the Nightwatchman's pick to correctly learn the Nightwatchman in a Vortox game?
A The Nightwatchman, because they are the source of the information.

  In a Vortox game, the Nightwatchman picks a player, and that player learns someone else as something other than the Nightwatchman.
  The Monk protection can stop the Vortox from making info false,
  but in order for the target to learn the correct player as the Nightwatchman,
  it is the Nightwatchman as the source of the ability that needs to be protected when they use their ability, not their target.
  If the target is Monk-protected then the misinformation is not prevented.

--------------combine?
Q Does the Philosopher Snitch and the Cannibal Snitch causes each Minion to learn three in play characters in a Vortox game?
A Yes.

  Townsfolk who gain an Outsider ability are still affected by the Vortox's falsifying of information.

Q What does the Vortox learn if the Cannibal eats the Lunatic or the Philosopher gains the Lunatic ability?
A The Vortox learns the wrong player as their Lunatic and the wrong players for the Lunatic's picks.
---------------


Q How does the Pixie interact with the Vortox?
A The Pixie learns an out of play Townsfolk.
  An arbitrary player is marked whose role does not matter.  The marked player could in fact be a Minion, but probably should not be the Demon.
  If the marked player dies, the Pixie would gain the ability they were shown if they were sufficiently mad as that role.

Q How does the Pixie work when the Vortox is N1 drunk or poisoned and later sober and healthy?
A If the Vortox is N1 drunk or poisoned then the Pixie will correctly see an in play character.

  If the Vortox is later sober and healthy when the Pixie's marked Townsfolk dies,
  then the Pixie gains the ability that they saw, 
  which if it is an info ability will be affected by the Vortox.



Q Does an evil Townsfolk (Mezepheles / Bounty Hunter / ...) still receive false info in a Vortox game?
A Yes.


:what is falsifiable in a Vortox game?
-----------------reword
Q The Alchemist Fearmonger in a Vortox game ...  does the ST announce that the Fearmonger has picked a new player?
A Yes.

  Public or even private announcements are not information.
  Only _who_ is information for the purposes of the Vortox.

  For example:
  * preached Minions still learn they have been preached,
  * exorcised Demons still learn they have been exorcised (they just learn the wrong player),
  * the Philosopher-Damsel would still inform the Minions that the Damsel is in play.

  So the ST should still announce that the Fearmonger has selected a new player.

Q In a Vortox game what do Minions learn when they were chosen by the Preacher?
A That they were chosen by the Preacher, same as a non Vortox game, as being told that you were picked by a player is not part of the vortoxable information.
  If it were an ability where you learnt _who_ picked you (such as when the Exorcist picks the Vortox) then that would part would be falsified.

Q How does the Nightwatchman ability work in a Vortox game?
A The target of the Nightwatchman / Philosopher Nightwatchman / Cannibal Nightwatchman / Pixie Nightwatchman wakes up and learns they were picked by the Nightwatchman but is shown the wrong player.

  The Vortox says Townsfolk abilities yield false info
  and info passing characters such as the Nightwatchman are ruled that the ability name/type is not part of the vortoxable information -
  "someone with the NWM ability chose you" is a mechanical explanation of why someone woke up,
  and [ST points to a player] is the information.

Q Does the Soldier, who is safe from the Demon, correctly learn the Nightwatchman if picked in a Vortox game?
A No. The source of the information is the Nightwatchman and they are not safe from the Demon.

Q When a player is D1 executed but does not die, the Undertaker does not wake, but does the Oracle wake to learn whether it is a Vortox game?
A Yes.

Q The Philosopher picks the Damsel ability in a Vortox game.
  Do the Minions still learn the Damsel is in play?
A Yes.

  Being targeted by an ability (Damsel, Nightwatchman, Exorcist, Preacher, King, etc) is not falsified in a Vortox game,
  though any information that goes along with it would be
  (in the case of Nightwatchman, Exorcist, and King that is the learning of a player),
  though that does not apply to Damsel (even filtered through Philosopher), so they just simply learn the Damsel is in play.

Q If in a Vortox game that contains both the Damsel and the Philosopher Damsel, what do Minions learn?
-----  Seems learning that the Damsel is in play would be true information derived from a Townsfolk ability (Philo)
-----  but learning a different character/nothing at all seems incorrect also.
A Minions learn that the Damsel is in play.

  Being woken due to an ability to learn <ability> affected you or is in play
  is a mechanical aspect not affected by Vortox; only learning specifically who is.
  
  Consider similar interactions in Vortox games:
  A Minion that is selected by the Preacher is still told that they have been preached.
  If the Demon is picked by the Exorcist, the Demon learns this but learns the wrong player.
  The demon learns that the King is in play, but not the correct person.

Q The Magician Vortox interaction... does it work the same way as Philosopher Lunatic in a Vortox game, where the Demon learns a wrong name?
A No. 
  The Magician already gives false information because she appears as a Minion. So, with a Vortox or with another Demon, there is no difference.

Q Does the Noble have to see all good players in a Vortox game? Or can they see 2-3 evil players too?
A They can see anything but two good and one evil. Including all evil.

Q Is it possible to learn true information in a Vortox game due to a character misregistering?
  For example,
  can the Empath who should learn a zero when they neigbour a good player and the Spy registering as good, 
  instead learn a one in a Vortox game?
A Yes.
  It was previously thought not, but since the ruling that the Fortune Teller's Red Herring yields a "no" in a Vortox game, 
  the majority (but not universal) view is that this generalises to other kinds of misregistration, including the Spy's. 

Q Does the Grandmother's grandchild have to be an evil player in a Vortox game?
A No.
  The Vortox'd Grandmother has to learn one of player and character wrong for their grandchild.
  They can learn the right player wrong role, right role wrong player, etc.

  Notably, they do still have a good player as a grandchild and will still die if that player is killed by the Vortox,
  because that is a mechanical effect, which the Vortox cannot falsify.

Q Is the Gossip affected by the Vortox?
A No, the Gossip is not considered an info role. 

Q If the Vortox dies and the game continues for whatever reason,
  is the Vortox ability now nullified and thus all information reverts back to being true, barring droison?
A Yes. Since players lose their ability when dead, then the Vortox's ability of forcing false Townsfolk info is no longer in effect.

Q Would the Alchemist Pit-Hag in a Vortox game make people learn the wrong character?
  Or is that not 'information'?
  What about the Alchemist Cerenovus?
  What about Minions that make a public announcement like the Vizier and the Fearmonger,
  would the ST announce incorrect information?
A Learning your character and alignment is never "information" for the purposes of the Vortox.
  Learning what character you are mad as is not information. 

Q In a Vortox game, does the ST lie to the Amnesiac about their guesses?
A Yes.  For example, if they asked if their ability was to do with voting and it was not should you still give them a warm/hot?

Q If the Nightwatchman is in a Vortox game, the player chosen will be shown anybody, but the Nightwatchman, including a Minion.
  If the Preacher chooses a Minion in a Vortox game, does the Minion get the info their ability stops working or not?
  Is it a Townsfolk ability yielding false info?
A Being told one has been chosen by an ability does not get falsified with Vortox, so a Minion would learn they were chosen by the Preacher.
  If it is accompanied by learning a player, such as in your Nightwatchman example, or also, for example, Exorcist, then the player shown must be false.

Q What do the evil team learn if the Poppy Grower dies in a Vortox game?
A Because the info is coming from a Townsfolk ability it must be falsified, then RAW each evil player must be told incorrect info.

  The ST can show the Minions and the Demons only good players,
  but evil Townsfolk, if there are any, can be shown.
  
  More specifically team red must learn non-Minions as Minions and non-Demons as Demons,
  so as a workaround Minions could learn another Minion as the Demon and, if this is a 2+ Minion game, the Demon as a Minion.
  The Vortox will still have to learn non-Minions as their Minions but they will at least know that their info is wrong.

Q What does the Knight learn in a Vortox game?
A The Knight learns two players one of which is the (or possibly a) Demon.

Q In a Vortox game, what should the Fortune Teller get when they hit their Red Herring?
A They would get a "no".

Q Can the Recluse create true info in a Vortox game?
  For example the Chef sees the Recluse as evil, so sees a pair where there is no pair, so learns there is no pair, which is true information despite the Vortox.
A It was previously ruled "no", but since the Vortox/FT ruling came out most people would say "yes". 

  The FT's Red Herring can cause them to get a "no" when they choose the Red Herring but not the demon (and a Vortox is in play). 
  It has been controversial, but the concensus is that this implies that the Vortox can flip information after accounting for misregistration.

Q How does the Bounty Hunter interact with Vortox misinformation?
A They learn a good player. When that good player dies, they learn another good player.
  Even if the Vortox is killed, droisoned, etc., the BH is only shown a new player after the death of the shown good player; 
  the BH never gets their information corrected.

  The BH is shown a player and they will only ever get a new name when that player dies, regardless of that player's actual alignment.

Q Is the Apprentice immune to the Vortox due to being a Traveller, or does their Townsfolk ability still yield false info?
A Travellers get true information in a Vortox game.
  An Apprentice getting info from a Townsfolk ability is not a Townsfolk player, they are a Traveller player.

Q Can the Fibbin cause a Townsfolk to get true information in a Vortox game?
A Yes.

Q If the Fool does not die by execution for the first time, does it count as a succesful execution for the Vortox?
A Yes, any execution will satisfy the Vortox's condition, even if it does not lead to death.

Q How does the Vortox affect the Balloonist's information?
A Each Balloonist reminder token is placed next to a character that is not that character type,
  so the Balloonist basically just gets four arbitrary names.

  Note that the four names the Balloonist learns cannot be one Townsfolk, one Outsider, one Minion and one Demon.

Q What do you tell the Savant in a Vortox game?
A The Savant is given two false statements.

Q Does the Vortox learn of the King or the Exorcist?
A The Vortox correctly learns that the Exorcist / King are in play but always learns the wrong person.

Q D1, a Minion is executed while the Minstrel is in play, so the Vortox is drunk. If on D2 no one is executed, does the evil team win?
A ST choice; it could go either way.

  Two actions that occur at dusk would attempt to happen at the same time:
  * At dusk tomorrow, all players made drunk by the Minstrel become sober; the ST removes the EVERYONE IS DRUNK reminder.  
  * Each dusk, if no player was executed today, the game ends and the evil team wins.

  This is an order of operations issue.  Whichever happens first loses the interaction.

  One interpretation:
  The Vortox will be drunk until dusk. 
  The day ends with no execution, then dusk happens, so the Vortox is still drunk at the point they otherwise would have won.
  They do not become undrunk until that start of the night phase.
  The game continues.

  Alternative interpretation:
  First the Minstrel's tokens are removed, then we check the Vortox wincon. Evil wins.

  Given that the Vortox was drunk up until literally that moment, arguably it makes more intuitive sense that they would fail to win the game.

=============
=Washerwoman=
=============
Q Can the Washerwoman see two village idiots?
A Yes.

=======
=Widow=
=======
Q Does the Widow know which good player is told that they are in play?
A No.

  The player is decided after the Widow makes their choice.  Also there is no knows token for the Widow to see in the Grimoire.

Q When does the Widow get to poison in a Poppy Grower game?
A After the PG dies and they see the Grimoire for the first time; they do not get to poison blind N1, not even themselves.
  This means that the Widow announcement is guaranteed to go out on their first night.

Q Does the Widow get to see first night information reminder tokens when they view the Grimoire?
  For example, if the Washerwoman was going to see the Soldier, should those tokens be placed before the first night,
  or directly before the WW step; is that information that the Widow gets to know?
A Anything that looks at the Grimoire sees what the ST has in there.
  Most STs choose to leave those tokens in, but they technically do not have to.

Q If the good player who knows the Widow is in play turns evil, and the Widow still has their ability, does a new good player get pinged?
A Yes, a new good player is woken and shown the Widow character token.

Q The Pit-Hag creates the Widow.  Does the Widow see the Grimoire that night or the next?
A That night; it is their first night, so they should be immediately woken and shown the Grimoire.

  Note that the Widow is not an info role that must wait for poisoners and killers to act first.
  They have a mechanical ability that lets them see the Grimoire and poison someone as soon as they come into play.

Q If the Widow is created mid game (Engineer / Pit-Hag / Hatter / ...) when does a good player get told?
A A good player learns of the Widow that night.

=======
=Witch=
=======
Q If the Witch cursed player tries to nominate an already nominated player, do they still die?
A They should not die, as the nomination is not valid.
  However mistakes happen, so if the player mistakenly nominates and then the ST were to mistakenly act on the Witch curse,
  the best solution is for the ST to admit there was a mistake made, apologise, and continue on as best they can,
  with the player dead.
  The ST could ask if they would like to nominate someone else instead but they are staying dead regardless.


=============
=Yaggababble=
=============
Q What is the Exorcist jinx with the Yaggababble?
A If the Exorcist chooses the Yaggababble, the Yaggababble ability does not kill tonight.

=========
=Zombuul=
=========
Q Does the Scarlet Woman become the Demon after the Zombuul dies for the first time?
A Yes, so there will be two acting demons, which makes SW and Zombuul a bad combination.

Q If the Zombuul neighbouring the Tea Lady dies for the first time, do they register as the TL's neighbour?
A No.

Q If the Zombuul is registering as dead and there are only two other players are alive, does evil win?
A No, the Zombuul registering as dead does not count for evil's win condition.

Q If the once-killed Zombuul is drunked or poisoned, does the game end?
A No, the game continues because importantly the Zombuul has never actually died.
  Their death shroud is not removed and nothing is announced to town.
  They no longer register as dead for roles like the Tea Lady and the Oracle that care about living status.
 
Q If the Zombuul that has not already died once is killed while drunk or poisoned, what happens?
A The droisoned Zombuul dies for real even if they have not used their extra life.

Q If the Zombuul loses its first life, would an Oracle's number rise by one? 
A Yes.

Q In a Zombuul game, if a dead player is executed again, would the Zombuul wake the following night to kill?
A Yes, the Zombuul's ability checks whether a player died, and dead players cannot die.

Q The first time a Zombuul is executed, do they still wake at night to kill, if no other player dies that day?
A No, their "death" registers even to their own ability so the following night they do not wake.

Q If a dead player becomes the Zombuul (Pit-Hag / Hatter / Engineer /...) do they return to life as a once-killed Zombuul?
A No, they are the genuinely dead Zombuul.

  It is only the Zombuul's ability that allows it to misregister as dead that gives them a second life,
  and dead players do not have abilities unless specified otherwise.

Q Is the once-killed Zombuul who either swaps with a Minion (Barber) or becomes another Demon (Pit-Hag / Engineer / Hatter)
  just the dead version of her new character?
A No, she is alive but remains appearing as dead.
  Nothing in the ability prompts the ST to announce anything about her life/death status
  since her status has technically not changed.
  As a result the town do not know to flip her life token back over:
  in person, the town square is maintained by the players, not the ST,
  and online the ST simulates what the players would do.
 
  From the players' perspective nothing has changed,
  but abilities that care about living status are affected: she does not register as dead, so abilities can see, choose and impact her.

  The Zombuul does not mix well with character changers; it is kind of awkward no matter how it is run.

Q Does the "dead" Zombuul have a ghost vote?
A Yes.

Q Can the "dead" Zombuul vote more than once?
A After their first vote while registering as dead they would lose their ghost vote.
  Mechanically they can vote again but voting more than once while appearing dead would out them, so probably a bad idea.
  Some STs would rule that the Zombuul cannot vote again and would not count any ghost votes after the first.

Q The Zombuul is executed.
  Then, the Engineer picks another non-Zombuul Demon from the script.
  How does nominating and voting work for the former Zombuul?

A When the Zombuul dies for the first time they:
  * are given a death shroud,
  * have one dead vote for the rest of the game,
  * register as dead,
  * cannot nominate, and
  * do not count towards the majority needed to execute.

  When swapped, the former Zombuul
  * still keeps their death shroud but
  * can vote freely,
  * no longer registers as dead, and
  * can nominate, and
  * affect the number of votes needed to execute

  As soon as they start nominating and voting freely they are outed, so they probably do not want to do that.
  The number of votes needed for execution could also tip off town that there is a fake dead Demon somewhere.

:Fang Gu / Pit-Hag:  
  
Q If the Pit-Hag creates a Fang Gu and the arbitrary kill at night kills an Outsider, can that cause the Fang Gu to jump? 
A If the Fang Gu themselves targeted that Outsider, the ST can choose to allow the kill to go through and thus the Fang Gu to jump.
  The ST can also choose to block the Fang Gu's choice of an Outsider and have them die to the Pit-Hag with no jump.

  Or, of course, the ST can block the kill entirely and not kill the Outsider to either ability.

  If the Fang Gu did not target an Outsider, they cannot jump - if that Outsider dies, it is only to the Pit-Hag's ability and not to the Fang Gu's.


Q The Pit-Hag turns another Minion into the Fang Gu.  The new Fang Gu targets an Outsider.
  As deaths are arbitrary tonight, is the jump blocked, or is it legal to kill off the old Demon, and allow the jump to happen, killing off the first Fang Gu
  and the targeted Outsider becoming the new evil Fang Gu?

A Each Demon's choices are still taken, which the ST does not have to abide by, 
  with any arbitrary protections or deaths occurring from the Pit-Hag.

  It would therefore be valid for the Fang Gu’s jump to be processed as per usual,
  with the newly created Demon dead and the Outsider converted, on top of the arbitrary death of the original Demon.

  However, it would not be legal to kill the Fang Gu and have some other random unselected Outsider converted instead.

  In full, the ST's options are:
  # The Fang Gu kills the Outsider, so the jump happens i.e. the normal Demon kill goes through; any other deaths are due to the PH.
  # The Fang Gu does not kill the Outsider, so there is no jump and the Outsider remains alive i.e. the PH's "deaths are arbitrary" ability
  # The Fang Gu does not kill the Outsider, but the Pit-Hag does, so the Outsider dies but there is no jump i.e. the PH's arbitrary deaths ability
 

Q If the Pit-Hag creates the Fang Gu and then the Fang Gu chooses an Outsider at night, and the ST allowes his kill to go through,
  does this also make the Fang Gu jump? Does the kill come from the Pit-Hag's ability or not?
A Either. The way Pit-Hag arbitrary deaths works is that the ST can block any kills (or not), and can cause new kills originating from the Pit-Hag.
  If the ST allows the Fang Gu kill to go through, it jumps. If they prevent it but then kill that player anyway with the Pit-Hag ability, then there is no jump. 

Q If the Pit-Hag changes the Demon into the Fang Gu, can the Fang Gu jump that same night?
  Does the Demon's choice matter at all that night or, because of the Pit-Hag's deaths are arbitary ability, are all deaths caused by the Pit-Hag instead of the Demon?
A The ST can allow the Fang Gu to jump.

  ..ST's options are as follows, assuming the new Fang Gu chooses an Outsider when deaths are arbitrary:

  If the new Fang Gu targets an Outsider then, since deaths are arbirtary, the choices are:
  # the chosen Outsider is PH protected and does not die;
  # the chosen Outsider is PH protected and does not die, but then is PH killed, so no jump;
  # the chosen Outsider dies to the Fang Gu, so the jump happens.

  "Deaths are arbitrary" means the ST can allows deaths go go through, or not go through.
  So if the ST allows the Demon's choice to go through, that one is an attack from the Demon, not the PH,
  and if the ST blocks it, then it is treated similarly to the player being protected from the demon that night.
  Any "additional" deaths are considered attacks from the PH.



:droisoning:
Q Can a drunk or poisoned player gain true info from their ability?
A Yes, unless it is a Vortox game when their info must be false.

Q If the Courtier drunked Demon makes a choice, then the Courtier dies by a Gossip that night, does the Demon's kill go through?
A No.
  The Demon was drunk at the time their ability would have fired,
  the malfunction means no reminder token would have been placed, 
  so at no point was anyone marked to die.

Q If the Preacher was drunk when he chose a Minion, will that Minion be preached when the Preacher becomes sober?
A No.  Mechanical abilities used while drunk have no effect on other players.

Q If a player that wakes at night is drunk or poisoned, could the ST just skip them?
A No, drunk / poisoned players are never skipped. The ST should deceive them that their abilities are functioning normally,
  otherwise it would confirm to the player that they are either drunk or poisoned.

----Needs editing
Q Reminder tokens are placed/removed regardless of drunkenness or poisoning:
  * a drunk Juggler will still place "correct" reminder tokens,
  * a drunk Gossip will still place its "dies tonight" token,
  * a Minstrel will still place its "everyone drunk" token, etc.

  The drunkenness/poisoning simply disables the ability that makes these tokens do anything.

  So what happens when the normal flow of an ability (place when needed, remove when checked at night phase) is interrupted, such as by droisoning or by a character change?
A A more broad rule of thumb:
  If the player was drunk/poisoned at the time of their ability then a token is not placed,
  and if no token is placed then it cannot "come back."

  If a token was placed and that is interrupted by drunk/poison and then the drunk/poison goes away,
  then the effect of the token comes back.

  However, backward looking roles are run differently,
  with their tokens placed down for the ST's benefit.
  Abilities like the Juggler, Gossip, Mathematician, Town Crier, and Flower Girl have reminder tokens
  that essentially do not actually take effect until the night phase
  and putting them down during the day is just to make the night easier for the ST.
  That is why the ST still tracks them,
  because when the info/mechanical part of their ability truly goes off,
  they need to know in case the character is not drunk/poisoned.
  It does not matter if they were droisoned when the tokens were being placed,
  as long as they are sober and healthy at the time they get their info, it will be correct.
  Conversely, if they were sober and healthy when the tokens were placed, 
  and droisoned at the time of getting their info, the info is arbitrary.

Q In a Poppy Grower game, the Vigor-killed Poisoner poisons the Vigormortis.  What happens?
A Endless drunk/poison loops are resolved by having all parties drunked/poisoned, until one effect wears off as it normally would.
  In this situation,  both the Poisoner and the Vigor are poisoned, and the poisoned Townsfolk is temporarily healthy while the Poisoner remains poisoned.

Q The Marionette has a special case for when the Preacher picks them that their ability stops working
  and the ST pretty much ignores them at night since thinking they are a Townsfolk is their ability.
  Could the same logic apply to the Drunk or the Lunatic being poisoned or drunked? 
  Or would that be too powerful and against the never reveal the Drunk unofficial rule?
A With drunkenness and poisoning, the goal is for the ST to still pretend their ability is still working,
  which for the Drunk / Lunatic means still pretending that they are the character that they think they are.
  So drunk and poison are not very similar to being preached.

Q Are there any characters that can make players sober and/or healthy? 
A There are:
  * A Barista one can make another player sober and healthy for the night they are chosen and the following day,
  * The Beggar makes herself sober and healthy at all times,
  * The Monk can protect from/remove a Demon's poisoning for one night (No Dashii / Pukka / Lleech / ...).

Q Can the poisoned Demon kill people? 
A No. Poisoned characters have no ability.

----------------combine
Q What would happen if someone who is drunk gets posioned?
A No real difference as they do the same thing.
  They do not stack but it is still important to track both in case one ends before the other. They are sometimes even used interchangably as "droisoned"

Q Poisoned is similar to drunk right?
A Poisoning and drunkeness mechanically work the same. 
  If an ability makes a player drunk or it makes a player poisoned, it has the same effect. 
  So, information is arbitrary and mechanical based abilities do not work at all.
  
  Being drunk and being poisoned are technically different for the purposes of Savant statements and Artist questions,
  although usually those would involve saying "drunk or poisoned” to catch all cases.
-------------------------------

Q If the Poisoner poisons the Minstrel, and the Poisoner is executed, is there a Minstrel night?
  Same for Widow too.
  Does the poison wear off before the Minstrel sees that a Minion died?
A This is a question of simultaneity, and there is no official answer.
  A valid interpretation is that at the moment the Minstrel sees the Poisoner as dead,
  they are not poisoned (because the Poisoner is dead), so the Minstrel procs.

Q If a character that is drunking or poisoning someone is changed into a different character, does the droisoning stay?
A No, because the ability that caused the droisoning no longer exists.
  
  Examples:
  * If the Imp self-kills and the Poisoner becomes the new Imp, then the Poisoner is no longer in play and is therefore not poisoning anyone.
  * If the Pit-Hag turns the Philosopher drunking the Savant into the Mutant, then the Philo is no longer in play and is therefore not drunking the Savant.
  * If the Pit-Hag turns the Puzzlemaster into the Klutz, the previously Puzzlemaster-drunk player is now sober.

Q If a character is poisoned, they become healthy if the character that is causing them to be poisoned no longer has an active ability. 
  How does this apply to a Snake Charmer, or does it not?
A The SC poisoned by another character would become healthy if the other character was drunked, poisoned or dead. 
  If the SC poisons themselves, infinite poison loops are resolved by applying the poison.

Q Can poisoning reapply? If a Courtier chooses the Imp but is poisoned on the second night of their ability, is the Imp sober or drunk on the third night of the ability?
A If droison would be applied while the character is themselves droisoned, it is not.
  If the ability was applied while sober and healthy, the reminder token is flipped upside down, 
  the target is temporarily sober/healthy and when the droisoner regains their ability, it continues to apply.
  So in this example the Imp is made drunk once again for the third night of the Courtier's ability.

Q If the drunk or poisoned Philosopher uses their ability to gain another ability, and later gets healthy again,
  do they have the functioning ability of their character of choice, or did they never use their ability? 
A Any once per game ability used while drunk or poisoned is spent, the Philosopher is no exception:
  their attempt to aquire an ability does not work and spends their OPG ability and, for as long as they remain droisoned,
  the ST should pretend the ability they received works, but once they are healthy the ST can no longer deceive them.

  In a reverse scenario, if the Philo was sober/healthy when they picked (so they gain the ability)
  but then became droisoned they may receive false info or their mechanical ability does not work,
  until they are sober and healthy again (when the ability will resume functioning normally).
  While droisoned the ST could even stop waking them up and pretend they were poisoned at the time they used their OPG ability
  (but if they become healthy, they would have to start waking them again).

Q What if the Philosopher is sober when they choose an ability, but they are drunk when they use it?
A They have gained the ability. While drunk/poisoned, they may receive false information or a mechanical ability does not work at all.
  When they are sober/healthy again, they go back to working normally.

Q If the Philosopher is drunked or poisoned, does the Philo drunk player become sober?
A Yes.


:The Demon:
Q Can there be more than one Demon in play at the start of the game?
A Only in a Legion or a Riot game.

Q Can a multi-kill Demon attack the same player twice? e.g. the Shabaloth tries to eat the Fool twice with both kills, 
  or the Al-Hadikhia chooses the same player three time, thus ensuring they die?
A No, it must be different players.

Q What happens when a multi-kill Demon (Al-Hadikhia / Po / Shabaloth) picks a protected player?
A This will likely depend on the source of the protection and the order of the Demon's picks. 

  If that player is protected due to their own ability (sober Sailor / Soldier) then they cannot die no matter who else dies that night.

  If the protection is due to another player (Tea Lady / Innkeeper / Monk) then that player cannot die, as long as source of the protection remains alive.
  This means who and the order of the Demon's picks is important:
  * If the source was not selected by the Demon, the protected player cannot die.
  * If the source was selected after the protected player, the protected player survives but then the source, barring any other forms of protection, will die.
  * If the source was selected before, then on their death (which includes choosing to die to the Al-Had), the protection is removed,
    and the target of their protection is no longer safe.

  In the case of the Al-Had, if all three players choose live, or all three are alive at the end of their choices, then all three die in the order that they were selected.
  Again, the order of death matters: the protected player survives if the source of the protection was picked afterwards (or not at all).

Q If a multi-kill Demon (Al-Hadikhia / Shabaloth / Po) kills two players where the first killed player was drunking the second, is the drunking removed before the second kill?
A Yes.

  The order of the kills is important: as long as the player causing the drunking dies before the drunked player, then the drunked player becomes sober.
  
  For example, the Philo-drunking is removed if the Philosopher dies before the original of the character.
  So if the Philo-Ravenkeeper and the Ravenkeeper both died in that order on the same night then they would both get sober info.

Q Can Demons choose dead players?
A Yes.

Q Demon bluffs ... what is allowed / recommended?
A The Demon should be shown three characters that are safe for her to bluff as, to avoid double claiming a good player.
  These characters should:
  * be any combination of Townsfolk and Outsiders; two Townsfolk and one Outsider is pretty common,
  * out of play
  * not be Minions; bluffs must be _good_ characters
  
  It is strongly recommended that whatever characters the Drunk or the Marionette believe themselves to be are not given as bluffs;
  although out of play, the Demon might not appreciate receiving these!
  Additionally, some STs would consider it illegal to do so; the argument is that the Demon should see three out of play _tokens_.
  But if the group is experienced it could be attempted, perhaps to signal to the Demon who the Drunk is.

Q If a new Demon is made, do they learn about the Marionette / Lunatic / King?
A A new Demon learns anything the Demon "knows" (Mario, King, etc.) that is currently still in play and active when they are created that they have not already been informed of. 

Q The Philosopher N1 takes on the ability of an out of play character.
  Since the Philosopher's turn comes before the Demon gets their bluff,
  is it correct to say that the Demon cannot get the role the Philosopher took as a bluff, since that role is in play?
A The Philo's pick has no affect on Demon bluffs.
  The Philo only ever gains the ability, she does not turn into the character, so the character remains out of play.

  Any character out of play on setup can be given as a bluff,
  and if the Philo chose one of those bluffs then it is just unlucky for evil if they do not pretend to have poisoned info.
  
  The Philo is before N1 evil info just so that she can take the Poppy Grower or Magician abilities which would affect evil info.

Q If the Demon is drunked or poisoned N1, can he get bad bluffs?
A No, because getting bluffs in not due to the Demon's character ability, and so cannot be disabled by poisoning or drunking.

Q Do the Demon and the Minions learn each other's role during the Demon and Minion info steps on N1?
A No, just they just learn who is on the evil team, not specific roles.


:voting:
Q In case of the Cult Leader starting a cult, are all good players supposed to vote including the dead players, or only the alive ones?
A Including dead players.
  Cult forming (like exiling travellers) is not a regular vote.  Dead players are included and dead votes are not used.
  Abilities that specify executions (e.g. Flowergirls) are not triggered.
  An organ grinder is not triggered.
  Only votes for execution count as votes for abilities per the glossary.

Q A call to exile a Traveller, the Demon votes.  Is the Flowergirl informed?
A No. Exiles are not executions: They do not require or use a vote token (and, as such, require the normal full majority),
  do not end the day, and do not interact with any abilities that specify executions.

Q Does the Flower Girl read the Cult Leader votes as well as votes from nominations?
A No, the Cult Leader does not use votes, only raised hands.

Q If someone dies during the day (Harpy / Tinker / Witch / ...), does this change the number of required votes,
  and can this put people on the block who were previously safe,
  having just gotten not quite enough votes before those players died?
A An execution requires the majority of living players to vote and to have the most votes of the day.

  So players dying can lower the number of votes required but
  * any nomination still needs to have more votes than any other in order to put someone on the block,
  * there is no impact on nominations that have already happened - whether someone is on the block or not is determined immediately in that moment,
  and any previously safe player is still safe.
  
  For example, if player X gets five votes and that is not enough and then people die and five would be enough now, player X is still safe,
  and another player would still need at least six votes in order to be put on the block.

Q Does a resurrected player get a ghost vote if they used it while dead the first time?
A Yes, each time a player dies they get a ghost vote token.

Q Can someone die (due to the Tinker, Slayer, Cerenovus, Harpy, .. ) during a vote? Must it wait until after?
  It feels like active abilities might make sense to be paused during a vote, but is this an official rule?
A Yes, players can die during a vote, nothing really stops that...
  on a practical level, it is unlikely for the Storyteller to do as they are busy spinning around in a circle counting votes.


:player conduct:
Q Would you allow the evil team to openly and loudly communicate their plans during the night phase in crucial game-winning moments?
A Sure, there is no rule against it.

-----------------reword
Q What can players say during the night phase?
A You can say whatever you want but with a few exceptions like not narrating what actions you do at night or saying that you did not wake up till the morning after.
  But if you want to give someone advice what to do at night based on info that was known the previous day absolutely do that,
  or as a minion lean over to your demon and tell them who they should kill.

Q Player A is made mad that player B is evil.  
  Another player suspects A is mad and asks her to prove if she is mad or not by saying something that could get her executed for breaking madness.
  Would saying something like "I am mad that player B is evil" count as breaking madness, despite her keeping madness the rest of the time?
A The ST should not consider this a madness break.
  
  Player A is doing that in an attempt to convince the town that they are not mad, and the intent and sincerity of their madness is still retained.
  Intent matters a lot more for madness than the words someone says.

  The group might want to address this issue together as asking someone who is mad to break it to prove that they are mad runs against the spirit of madness.
  
  All madness related abilities, except for Pixie, are phrased with "might" to stop the evil team from exploiting 
  forced executions from the Cerenovus and forced deaths from the Harpy
  in ways which go against the spirit of the characters.
  With the Mutant the "might" is used to ensure that it functions as an Outsider by making the execution happen at an inconvenient time for good.



:travellers:
Q If a Traveller is turned evil (Mezepheles) are they shown the Demon?
A No, only Travellers who start the game evil learn the Demon.

Q If the Traveller Goblin claims Goblin while they are executed, does evil win?
A No, as exiling is not executing.

Q Can dead players call for a Traveller to be exiled?
A Yes.

Q Can Travellers be made mad by the Cerenovus or the Harpy?
A Yes.

  And while Travellers cannot be nominated for execution, the ST can execute them for breaking madness.

Q Are there any character abilities that can influence whether a call to exile a Traveller succeeds or not?
A Yes:
  * the Tea Lady ability works on all good players including Travellers
  * the Apprentice Vizier cannot be exiled
  * the sober Apprentice Sailor cannot be exiled
  
Q Does the Apprentice Psychopath play roshambo if they are exiled?
A No, an exile is not an execution.

Q Where on their home scripts are Travellers on the night order?
A All of them act first if they act at night except for the Apprentice which will act at the turn in the night order of the ability she has. 

Q Does a Traveller being drunk or poisoned have any influence on them being exiled?
A Only when their ability would normally have saved them from exile  (Deviant / Apprentice Vizier / Apprentice Psychopath).

Q Can Travellers nominate? 
A Yes, they are treated the same as regular players.

Q In a game with multiple Demons (Legion / Riot / ...) what does an evil Traveller learn?
A They learn just one Demon player.

Q If a good player is babysitting Lil' Monsta are they still seen by an evil Traveller?
A Yes.

Q If a Traveller joins the game is their role immediatelly known to everyone or is it secret?
A Everyone knows what Traveller they are for as long as they are a Traveller.

Q Can Travellers deadvote?
A Yes, after exile they have one dead vote like other dead players.

Q Can the Pacifist save a Traveller from exile?
A No. The Pacifist can save a player from dying to execution, and exiles are not executions.

Q Can the Devil's Advocate save a Traveller from exile?
A No. The DA can save a player from dying to execution, and exiles are not executions.

Q If a Traveller breaks Cerenovus madness, would they be exiled?
A No, they would be executed ending the day.

-------------reword
Q Do Travellers count as players for end of game? If there is a Demon, a good Outsider, and a Traveller left in the day, is the game over? 
A No, Travellers do not count towards the end of game player count. The example situation is a game over.
  Travellers do not count towards the living count for final three purposes.
  Travellers do not count for the win condition.

Q Do Travellers count for the purpose of evil's end game condition of surviving to final two?
A No.

  For example, if a Traveller, the Demon and one other player are left alive, then evil wins.
-----------------

Q Do Travellers count for the King's ability?
A Yes, same as with votes, they always count for the total player alive number except for evil's win condition.

Q Do Travellers count as alive players for the Chambermaid ability?
A Yes.

Q If a Traveller voted on a nomination prior to their exile on the same day, does their vote still count?
A The votes for a nomination are immutable as soon as they are recorded by the ST.

  The Exiled Traveller's votes prior to their exile still count for that day.
  An exiled Traveller is still in the game, they are just dead.
  and they have one vote from the time they died, the same as any other dead player.

Q Does the Demon learn if a Traveller who has just joined is on their team? 
A No, the Demon never learns the alignment of a Traveller.
  An evil Traveller, however, does learn who the Demon is,
  so they can go ahead and tell the Demon as much
  though the Demon may not believe them - they could just be good and fishing!

Q What happens if the Apprentice Philosopher Snake Charmer chooses the real Demon?
A By default, nothing, because normally a Traveller cannot become a non-Traveller, which makes the Snake Charmer a poor choice for the Apprentice.
  However, if an optional rule mentioned in the rulebook that players can become Travellers and vice versa is used,
  then the Apprentice would become the Demon and publicly lose their Traveller status
  and the Demon would become the Apprentice, which everyone would know and ultimately makes Snake Charmer a poor choice for the Apprentice.
  A good example of why Apprentice is recommend for Bad Moon Rising and not Sects and Violets.

Q Can a good Traveller become a Farmer?
A Under standard rules Travellers cannot change characters so an alive good Traveller cannot become a Farmer.
  However, if the variant where this is legitimate is used, 
  then when a Travaller becomes a Farmer their life token in the town square is changed from a Traveller one to a standard one.

Q Do evil Travellers learn the Demon in Teensyville?
A Yes, but Travellers in a Teensy is pretty unbalanced.

Q Why are Travellers not recommended for six players?
A They are not really recommended for seven or less because at those numbers, the Traveller's ability/alignment may have too much of an impact balance-wise,
  and the game will be going pretty quickly anyway. 

Q Can Travellers be targeted by the Demon at night?
A Yes. Any ability that says players includes Travellers unless stated otherwise like Dreamer.

Q Can players pick Travellers with their abilities?
  e.g. can the Witch choose Travellers?
A Yes, if the ability just states player any player is valid. Any abilities that do not allow Travellers being chosen will specify it
  e.g. Dreamers cannot choose travellers.

Q If a Traveller is exiled, do they still retain a place in the circle affecting neighbours? 
A Yes. If they travel away, on the other hand, then they actually leave the game.

Q If a Traveller travels away, is their character considered to still be in play?
A No.  The ST removes their tokens and any ability they had or effects caused by them are gone, including anything "even when dead" related.

Q Do Travellers count towards the majority needed to execute?
A Yes.

Q If a Traveller with an ability that effects setup (like an Apprentice Ballonist or Apprentice Baron) is in the game during setup,
  do their setup effects happen?
A Yes.





:misc:
Q Is it possible to play with a group of 20 people?
A Yes, that is the maximum player count which is not played often: 15 residents and 5 Travellers. 

Q When a character with a 'no ability' reminder token dies (Fisherman / Artist / ...), is that token placed in the Grimoire?
A No, only after they have used their ability.
  When a player dies a death shroud is placed on their token which, except for abilities that persist on death, already indicates that they have no ability.

Q When in the night order are characters with first night info abilities woken if they are created mid game (Damsel / Pit-Hag / Pixie / Philosopher / Cannibal / ...)?
A After any killing, poisoning and drunking roles act.

Q If a "you think you are" character (Lunatic / Marionette / Drunk) is changed (Pit-Hag / Barber / Fang-Gu / ...) to the character that they think they are, are they told?
A Yes, all players learn when they change their character, including those that think they are something else.

Q Do regurgitated / resurrected players (Shabaloth / Professor / Al-Hadikhia) still act the night that they are brought back?
A They can if they wake after the ability that brought them back.

Q Do regurgitated / resurrected players (Shabaloth / Professor / Al-Hadikhia) that have used their once per game ability get another use?
A Yes.

Q What do Minions learn during Minion info?
A Assuming there is no Poppy Grower or Magician ability in play and this is not a Teensyville game, they are informed of
  * the Demon
  * their fellow Minions, but not the Marionette
  * the Damsel, if in play

  The Marionette, although a Minion, does not learn anything during Minion info.

Q Can misregistration affect setup, for example the Spy misregisters as an Outsider meaning the Baron only adds one extra Outsider,
  or the Recluse misregisters as a Minion meaning one fewer Minions?
A No, misregistration can only occur after the characters are in play.


Q If a backward looking character (Cannibal/Flowergirl/Gossip/Mathematician/Town Crier/Undertaker) comes into play
  (Damsel / Pit-Hag / Philosopher / Pixie / ...) does their ability come into effect the same night that they are created?
A Yes.

  If the ST is considering making the Damsel a backward looking character 
  then they should use the appropriate reminder tokens (Gossip reminder token for a a correct gossip, Demon voted, ...) throughout the game
  so that the information is ready to give out when the change happens.

Q If a new instance of a character with [setup abilities] (Balloonist / Bounty Hunter / Choirboy / Baron / Vigormortis / Godfather / Fang Gu / ...)
  enters mid game (Alchemist / Barber / Engineer / Pit-Hag / Damsel / Pixie / Philosopher / Cannibal / Apprentice / ...), do these effects still happen?
A No, setup abilities have no effect if they come into play after setup.
  Generally, when a player gains an ability mid game, any "you start knowing x" or "X knows who you are" happen, but any [setup ability] does not.

  So for example a new instance of the:
  * Baron [+2 Outsiders] does not turn Townsfolk into Outsiders,
  * Bounty Hunter [1 Townsfolk is evil] does not turn a Townsfolk evil 
  * Balloonist [+1 Outsider] ability does not turn a Townsfolk into an Outsider
  * Choirboy [+the King] does turn someone into the King

  There are exceptions due to jinxes:
  * the ST gaining the Baron ability because of the Plague Doctor does turn two Townsfolk into Outsiders
  * the Engineer creating Legion [most players are Legion] turns mulitple players into Legion
  * the Engineer or the Pit-Hag creating Riot [all Minions are Riot] turns evil players into Riot

  Also:
  * an Apprentice with [setup abilities] in play from the start of the game does affect the setup
  * some STs rule that the Philosopher gaining the Bounty Hunter ability _does_ turn a Townsfolk evil, otherwise they are learning an evil player without any downside

Q An alignment changer (Cult Leader / Goon) who is drunk, poisoned or actually the Drunk cannot swap alignment except via the Mezepheles.
  But could the ST deceive them into believing their alignment has changed when it has not?
A Yes but don't.

  Lying to a player about their alignment is not recommended as it rarely fun.
  However, nothing stops the ST from doing so,
  but they should exercise caution, erring on the side of not doing so,
  unless they are quite sure that the player/group would enjoy that kind of thing.

Q What does it mean when two characters are hate-jinxed?
A Only one jinxed character can be in play.  Typically it is because the characters just fundamentally do not work together.

Q Are good Minions (Pit-Hag / Barber) affected by characters such as the Hatter and the Minstrel?
A Yes.  Any ability that affects Minions will apply regardless of alignment unless otherwise stated.

Q If a player dies in the night because of a madness break (Cerenovus / Harpy / Mutant), is this announced?
A Yes, executions are always announced. Their death would not be announced until the morning though, assuming it did also cause a death.

Q After a player dies the ST does not reveal their identity, but is the dead player allowed to make their role public during the day phase?
A Anyone can say anything at any time including the dead.

Q Evil wins if only two players are alive.  What if there are only evil players alive?
A The game can end if there is no reasonable path to victory for good such as only evil left alive.

Q Is it allowed to drunk Outsiders with roles such as the Puzzlemaster, Innkeeper, Sailor and Sweetheart?
A Yes, but the ST probably should prioritise drunking Townsfolk when they can.

Q An evil player approaches the ST and informs her of what he is bluffing as, just in case a character checker (Juggler / Gambler / Dreamer / Undertaker / Ravenkeeper / ...) picks them.
  Is that okay?
A Not only is this acceptable, it should be encouraged.
  Players can tell the ST whatever they want and it is up to the ST whether they use that.

  Evil players have a better chance if they communicate their plans to the ST.
  With character checkers, especially when drunking and poisoning happens, the ST will want to use what they learn,
  and it really helps to build plausible deceptions.

  Good players can, and often should, also tell the ST their plans and information; they are allowed to scheme as much as evil players.



Q Does the game end if the Demon is on the block, but then only two players remain alive, due to for example the Gunslinger?
A Yes. The game ends with evil winning in that situation.

Q If a character causes an effect on another character, such as protection against the Demon, drunkenness, or poison,
  and if that character that inflicts the effect is dead for whatever reason, does the effect disappear immediately?
A All effects and abilities discontinue when a character dies or is no longer in the game
  (unless the death causes the effect or the ability and/or effect continues through death),
  so any reminders belonging to a dead character can safely be removed.

Q If a player dies and is resurrected in the same night, what does the Storyteller announce to Town?
A Nothing.

  The ST only announces visible changes to a player's life/death status.
  So if Town went to sleep with a player alive,
  and that player is alive in the morning,
  Town does not learn anything. 

  However,
  if the player has a start knowing ability, then it would activate again, so they would probably figure out what happened.

Q Does a player who is resurrected then immediately killed again learn this?
A No, most of the time.

  The player is not informed, nor is there an announcement in the morning, since the ST only announces visible changes to a player's life/death status.
  So any player who is revived and killed in the same night is unlikely to learn this.
  Exceptions:
  * the Ravenkeeper getting another use of their ability may surmise that they were revived and killed in the same night;
  * the Sage getting two new players would likely figure out that they were revived and then killed by a Demon in the same night.
  
Q When do 'you start knowing' roles get their info when mid game they are created / regurgitated / resurrected / picked by the Philosopher / eaten by the Cannibal?
A After drunking roles, poisoners and killers act; there is always a chance they are killed, poisoned or drunked before they receive their info.

Q If a player with first night info is resurrected/regurgitated/etc., and they get woken again,
  do they learn new info matching their character description, or does it stay the same?
A ST choice. 

  For example a resurrected Grandmother is treated as a new Grandmother and can get a new grandchild.
  If a new one is assigned, only the new grandchild being killed by the Demon triggers her death.
  Additionally, the new grandchild could be dead, protecting the Grandmother from being able to trigger their own death.
  
  For other first night info characters, if the info has not changed, they should technically be wakened and given the same info.
  It matters for several reasons, including droison, dying later, or being checked by the Chambermaid.

Q If a first night character gets revived, when are they shown their info?
A They get their new "starting” info after the poisoning and killing roles get to act.

  The Professor already acts after the poisoning and killing roles act,
  so if the Professor revives a night 1 role, they get their info immediately. 

  A dead N1 role may be revived by the Al-Hadikhia but then die again because all three chosen players picked live. 

  An Al-Hadikhia or Shabaloth revived N1 role may also be sniped by the Assassin or other killing role before getting their new info.
------------

Q If the Demon is dead and the Evil Twin alive, evil wins the game if the good twin is executed.
  But why would this not lead to a tie? By executing the good twin, good has resolved the twin pair, and the Demon is dead, creating a tie. Should good then win? 
A Ability trumps over general game rule.
  So if two abilities cause a game tie, then the good one will win. If there is an ability game end condition and a regular game end condition, the ability wins out. 
  If two regular game end conditions are met at once, it is a tie and good wins.
  There are some exceptions for if it is impossible for one team to win, but the Evil Twin in SnV is not one of them.

Q In a six player game there is already one Outsider,
  but if the Baron is added and there is only one other Outsider on the script,
  such as is the case with No Greater Joy,
  is only one more Outsider added?
A Yes.
  In general, there can only be a maximum of the amount of Outsiders that are on the script, because players cannot have duplicate tokens.
  So even if there is Outsider modification that equals up to having six total Outsiders in play, if the script only has four Outsiders on it, only four would be in play.
  This does not come up in most scripts though;
  the Baron in a six player Teensyville with only two Outsiders on the script is probably where the limit being hit is most often seen.

Q What exactly are jinxes?
A Jinxes are official special rules indicated by the Djinn fabled that fix issues or weird interactions between two characters
  that make one character useless, OP, or nonsensical due to the other.
  The rules are modified slightly so they work together properly or make the game more fun.
  The BotC app puts in the Djinn automatically for scripts with jinxes and it cannot be removed.
  
  The ST cannot create jinxes but they can create house rules.

Q A "gained" ability disappears when the ability that caused the player to gain it leaves play, right?
  So the Cannibal eating the Philosospher and choosing the Pixie would not keep the Pixie ability after another execution.
A Correct, once the Cannibal gains a new ability, they lose the Philosopher ability meaning they lose the Pixie ability.

Q Could more than one person get the same token, such as the Marionette and the Drunk both receiving the same Townsfolk token?
A This is not possible in an official capacity without the Bootlegger Fabled character in play
  and would require putting the same token in multiple times.
  If intending to use the Marionette to pull this off then it also needs one of those tokens to fall next to the Demon (or Recluse),
  or using the Gardener Fabled to assign characters.

Q Is multiple madnesses just a death sentence? 
  e.g. the Mutant, made Cerenovus-mad as an Outsider, is just dead no matter what they do?
A It is a tricky situation for the Mutant for sure but is up to the ST,
  who possibly might consider the game state, on whether to execute or not.

Q Do dead characters register for abilities that say "in play" (Philosopher / Pit-Hag / Plague Doctor / Snitch ...)?
A Players who are dead are still their character, and so are still in play.
  * the Philosoper who gains the ability of a dead character means that character is dead and drunk
  * the Pit-Hag who wants to create another Barber will first have to change the dead Barber to some other character
  * after the Plague Doctor dies the dead in play Fearmonger means the Witch cannot gain this ability, unless all Minion abilites are in play

Q If a character with a one time use ability uses it and then dies later in the game and then is revived do they get the ability back?
A Yes. Even though it says 'once per game' it is a new instance of the character and it is as if the game has reset for them.



Q What happens if the game gets to a final two with a good Demon and a Townsfolk?
A Evil wins.
 
Q If two characters ever have the same night ability, is there an order for which activates first?
A No, because certain examples of this can cause issues if run one way, and others cause issues if run the other way.
  The ST should use their best judgement to choose the order that is least likely to cause a severe disruption to the game state.

Q In a base zero Outsiders game with a Vigormortis (-1 Outsiders) and Sentinel (+1 Outsiders) in play, can there be an Outsider?
A There can be, but most STs will do cumulative outsider modification, not sequential,
  which means there could not be an Outsider with only the Sentinel and the Vigor in play.
  While Outsider modification is allowed to be sequential most players tend to prefer cumulative.

Q After a player is executed for breaking madness (Cerenovus / Mutant) does that count as the single execution and immediately ends the day?
A Yes, unless the Butcher is in play.
